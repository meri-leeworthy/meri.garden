Background

[1]  On 30 March 2022, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (‘VCAT’) found that the respondent had contravened section 93 of Part 6 of the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Vic) (‘EOA’) by sexually harassing the applicant in the course of their mutual employment with Gumboots Australia Pty Ltd, which is now in liquidation. VCAT ordered that the respondent pay the applicant $10,000 in general damages and dismissed claims for special and aggravated damages.[1](https://plus.lexis.com/apac/document/?pdmfid=1539278&crid=2e8d04f8-ffc8-4399-87e9-d38277eb7435&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases-au%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A69GP-KWH1-F4NT-X046-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=267716&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&prid=1689b794-a4ca-429a-8390-0e55b297efc3&ecomp=s85k&earg=sr34#) The applicant appealed on the grounds that the award of general damages was manifestly inadequate.

[2]  McDonald J. upheld the appeal and remitted the proceedings to be heard by another member of VCAT only in relation to the following issues:

- (i) Further evidence as to the applicant’s current psychological condition and prognosis;
- (ii) Whether the applicant’s position was made redundant on 19 March 2020, and if so, whether the applicant’s employment would have been terminated at that time (which relates to special damages for lost income);
- (iii) A reassessment of the question of general, special and aggravated damages; and
- (iv) The applicant’s legal costs.

[3]  McDonald J. specified:

> The rehearing of the proceeding is not an opportunity for the Respondent to recontest the Senior Member’s findings at [48] to [76] of the reasons that the Respondent engaged in conduct in contravention of the EO Act. The further hearing should also be conducted on the basis that the evidence as set out at [81] to [93] regarding the psychological impact on the Applicant of the contravening conduct is not open to challenge. However, on remittal the Tribunal is not bound by the Senior Member’s findings at [94] and [96] to [99] which I consider to be inconsistent with the medical evidence accepted by the Senior Member.[2](https://plus.lexis.com/apac/document/?pdmfid=1539278&crid=2e8d04f8-ffc8-4399-87e9-d38277eb7435&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases-au%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A69GP-KWH1-F4NT-X046-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=267716&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&prid=1689b794-a4ca-429a-8390-0e55b297efc3&ecomp=s85k&earg=sr34#)

[4]  VCAT made directions on 13 April 2023 for the exchange of affidavits and submissions (time was extended on 25 May 2023) between the parties. Procedural orders were made on 6 June, 13 July, and 28 July 2023. At a directions hearing on 10 August 2023 I refused the respondent’s request for inspection of a Workcover report from 2020 requested by the respondent as it went to causation and liability issues which are not within the scope of the remittal.

[5]  The remitted hearing proceeded in one day on 5 October 2023. The applicant called Dr Shannon Paisely to give evidence on his updated report about the applicant’s current psychological condition and prognosis. The applicant and the respondent gave evidence and made submissions. I reserved my decision.

## Order

- 1 The respondent will pay the applicant $110,000.00 in general damages and special damages of $29,250.04.
- 2 The application for aggravated damages is dismissed.
