The applicant’s applications for costs are otherwise dismissed.


**REASONS**

1. In late 2011, during the course of her year 11 studies, Ms Ella Ingram and her mother decided she could join a school tour to New York scheduled for 30 March to 11 April 2012.  The required deposit and subsequent instalments were all paid.  Some of the costs were applied to a travel insurance policy issued by QBE Insurance (Australia) Ltd (QBE) on 8 December 2011.
    
2. In about January 2012, for the first time in her life, Ms Ingram experienced symptoms of depression.  Over the course of the following months she was diagnosed with that illness and received treatment.  In consultation with her doctors and mother, Ms Ingram decided not to go on the planned school trip, in the interests of her health. 
    
3. In about April 2012, Ms Ingram’s mother made enquiries about claiming the cost of the trip on the QBE policy.  The claim for $5,860 was lodged in May 2012 and was denied by QBE on 17 August 2012.  The refusal was confirmed by a further letter sent on 4 December 2012.
    
4. In rejecting the claim, QBE relied upon a general exclusion that said, in summary, there is no cover where the claim arises directly or indirectly due to mental illness. There is no dispute that the definition of mental illness in the policy includes depression.  In its 4 December 2012 correspondence to Ms Ingram’s mother, QBE said that the decision to refuse the claim was based on detailed statistical modelling and analysis of claims arising from a range of causes including mental illness.  QBE said that mental illness is excluded from the policy because its statistics demonstrated that in travel policies there is a high risk of cancellation because of mental illness.
    
5. Ms Ingram said by including the mental illness exclusion in the policy, QBE treated her unfavourably because of her disability and directly discriminated against her in the terms on which it provided the service of travel insurance. Ms Ingram said that conduct was a breach of section [44(1)(b)](https://jade.io/article/281882/section/7874) of the _[Equal Opportunity Act 2010](https://jade.io/article/281882)_ [(Vic)](https://jade.io/article/281882) (EOA). Ms Ingram further said that, by refusing to indemnify her in August and December 2012 on the basis of her mental illness, QBE treated her unfavourably because of her disability and so directly discriminated against her contrary to section [44(1)(a)](https://jade.io/article/281882/section/7180) of the EOA.
    
6. Ms Ingram has sought a declaration that QBE unlawfully discriminated against her, compensation for economic loss and the damage of hurt and humiliation suffered by her and costs.  The economic loss claimed is $4,292.48 which takes account of a flight costs refund. Ms Ingram sought $20,000 in compensation for hurt and humiliation.
    
7. QBE denied discriminating against Ms Ingram.  In its defence it said that it did not refuse to provide insurance to Ms Ingram because of her disability. Rather, the policy wording contained an exclusion for mental illness. [[1]](https://jade.io/#_ftn1)   Further or alternatively, QBE said that, if it did discriminate against Ms Ingram in either of the ways alleged, that discrimination was lawful because an EOA and/or a _Disability Discrimination Act 2004_ (Cth) (DDA) exception applied.
