A.2 Decomposable Multi-Recipient Public Key Encryption A multi-recipient PKE (mPKE) [ 13 , 43 , 56 ] is a type of PKE that allows a party to send the same message to a set of recipients of size ùëÅ , more efficiently than executing ùëÅ parallel runs of a standard PKE. In this work, we use a decomposable m PKE introduced in [ 40] that mandates a m PKE ciphertext to be decomposable into a recipient-dependent and independent part. [40] showed that many assumptions known to imply PKE (e.g., DDH, LWE, SIDH) can naturally be used to construct an IND-CCA decomposable mPKE in the random oracle model

Multi-recipient PKE. For pre-quantum security, one may combine Kurosawa‚Äôs multi-recipient variant [ 43 ] of ElGamal with the transform of [40], whose decomposability property makes it amenable to the selective downloading performed by Chained CmPKEctxt.
