**'political proper'** p.21
> In Scenes of Subjection, Saidiya Hartman situates her interest in a “**politics in a lower frequency**” in the conditions of African enslavement. Hartman notes that because the forms of resistance among enslaved Africans were “excluded from the locus of the ‘political proper,’ ” the agencies of the enslaved Africans must be reconceptualized from the perspective of “the ==nonautonomy of the field of action==; provisional ways of operating within the dominant spaces; ==local, multiple, and dispersed sites of resilience that have not been strategically codified or integrated==; and the nonautonomy and pained constitution of the slave as person.”14
> *makes me think a bit about narrative therapy, agency within oppressive conditions*
> \[...] These politics at a lower frequency would seem to fit nicely into the politics of axioms one through three, making devastatingly clear why it is so nec- essary to understand the social conditions of entangled existence. ==How are we to forge a new mode of political historiography unless we understand that the way social worlds are entangled directly alters the modes in which political resistance and resilience are expressed?==

p.26:
>"all concepts are precipitates from and for locations in the differential spaces of the entanglement of existence wrought by colonialism."
