- **(b)** **General damages**
    
- The purpose of the Courtâs statutory power to award damages for any loss or damage suffered because of the conduct under s [46PO(4)(d)](https://jade.io/article/218280/section/34856) is to compensate the applicant, not punish the respondent: **_[Wotton](https://jade.io/article/507578)_** _[v Queensland (No 5)](https://jade.io/article/507578)_ [2016] FCA 1457; 352 ALR 146 at [[1600]](https://jade.io/article/507578/section/62156) (Mortimer J, as the Chief Justice then was). When it came to the question of general damages, the only dispute, if liability was established, was as to quantum. In closing oral submissions, Ms Tickle sought an award of $100,000, while the respondents sought only a nominal sum in the order of a few thousand dollars if a finding of contravention was made. Neither stance was the subject of much more than assertion. The loss was not properly quantified or otherwise explained by Ms Tickle, and the figures advanced by the respondents accorded with their view that even if the Court concluded that they had discriminated, they had not done anything that was really of a kind that warranted more than a nominal response. I am unable to accept either stance.
    
- Ms Tickle has adduced no observational, medical or other expert evidence to quantify loss or damage. The only evidence she relies upon is contained in the following three short paragraphs of her affidavit:
    
    > [38]Â Â Â Â  The above events involving the Giggle App and Ms Grover have had a significant impact on my life. The respondentsâ unilateral decision that I am not a woman, and therefore cannot access the Giggle App, has upset me greatly and has resulted in me having to go to great lengths to prove that I am a woman. It has been exhausting and draining to do so.
    
    > [39]Â Â Â Â  Ms Groverâs public statements about me and this case have been distressing, demoralising, embarrassing, draining and hurtful. This has led to individuals posting hateful comments towards me online and indirectly inciting others to do the same. Ms Groverâs online posts reach large domestic and international audiences, which has led to the scale of online hate towards me being enormous. This has consumed my life outside of my work and sport, which has led to me experiencing constant anxiety and occasional suicidal thoughts.
    
    > â¦
    > 
    > [41]Â Â Â Â  I have been regularly taking anti-anxiety medication since May 2020 to assist with managing the emotional aspects of my gender transition. Ms Groverâs actions and the online hate I have received from her supporters, who are actively working towards stopping me from living as a woman, compounds my extant anxiety. I earnestly wish to wean myself off my anti-anxiety medication now that my gender transition is nearly complete, though I am fearful that my anxiety attacks will return if I do so, due to the stress and anxiety I have experienced from Ms Groverâs actions and this legal case.
    
- The whole of the evidence for loss or damage _because of_ the unlawful discrimination is contained in [38] and [41]. Paragraph 39 pertains to Ms Tickleâs claim for aggravated damages, made on the basis of comments by Ms Grover and her supporters subsequent to the filing of this application, discussed further at Part 6(c)(iv) below. The loss or damage alleged fall in two broad categories: injured feelings (described in [38]) and exacerbation of a pre-existing psychiatric condition (described in [41]). It is appropriate to address each separately.
    
- There is no evidence of loss or damage sufferance in any monetary sum, or in any non-monetary sum giving rise to a reasonable basis for equating or approximating it to that quantum. How the $100,000 proposed was arrived at was not explained. In my view such a large sum in the circumstances of this case called for detailed submissions. In the absence of such submissions, I am not satisfied that anything approaching that sum has even been attempted to be justified.
    
    **_(i)_**Â  **_Exacerbation of a pre-existing psychiatric condition_**
    
- It is well established that damages may be awarded for psychiatric injury, including exacerbation of an existing condition. Ms Tickleâs evidence at [41] of her affidavit is that she had started regularly taking unspecified anti-anxiety medication in May 2020, to assist with managing what she described as the emotional aspects of her gender transition. She does not say if she had been diagnosed with a psychiatric condition at that time and, if so, what that is, assuming that such evidence from her was admissible. She does not specify in any detail the kind of symptoms that led to a prescription of this medication, though later makes a reference to a fear that her anxiety attacks will return if she stops taking this medication, suggesting this has been a part of her previous experience. In short, the evidence is vague and makes it impossible to identify any starting point from which further harm can be adjudged.
    
- Ms Tickle goes on to say that Ms Groverâs actions and the online hate she has received from Ms Groverâs supporters has compounded her extant anxiety. Two difficulties arise here. The first is that it is not possible to identify how, if at all, the unlawful discrimination contributed to this condition. Her description of Ms Groverâs actions must refer, in the context of the affidavitâs preceding paragraphs, to her public comments about Ms Tickle (which are part of the basis of her claim for aggravated damages) and the removal of Ms Tickle from the Giggle App. The difficulty for referring to both together is that, as I explain at [[261]](https://jade.io/article/1087587/section/4687)-[[271]](https://jade.io/article/1087587/section/2239) below, I do not accept that Ms Groverâs comments about Ms Tickle can properly ground an award of aggravated damages. The second is that she also refers to online hate from persons she takes to be supporters of Ms Grover and again, as explained at [[256]-[260]](https://jade.io/article/1087587/section/159741) below, I cannot accept this can base an award of damages to be paid by the respondents.
    
- In the final part of [41] of Ms Tickleâs affidavit, she says that she wishes to halt her use of anti-anxiety medication, but fears that panic attacks will return due to the stress caused by Ms Groverâs actions and this proceeding. Again, the reference to Ms Groverâs actions must be read as a reference both to the removal of Ms Tickle from the Giggle App and Ms Groverâs subsequent comments, the latter of which cannot ground an award of damages. It is similarly unclear whether the stress and anxiety that Ms Tickle has experienced from this proceeding refers to the actions taken by the respondents in the course of this proceeding, and if so which; or from the general stress attached to any legal proceeding. The latter cannot be grounds for aggravated damages. More fundamentally however, this is only evidence of her speculation as to the future effect of halting the use of anti-anxiety medication while experiencing stress and anxiety. It is not a loss or damage that has eventuated. Ms Tickle is not a doctor or otherwise an expert on the matter, and so accordingly I cannot give this self-assessment any real weight.
    
    **_(ii)_** Â **_Injured feelings_**
    
- The evidence of Ms Tickleâs injured feelings is not similarly deficient. I accept that compensation may be awarded under s [46PO(4)](https://jade.io/article/218280/section/7144) for injured feelings, to adopt the term used by May LJ in _[Alexander v Home Office](https://jade.io/citation/2761913)_ [1988] 1 WLR 968 at [975](https://jade.io/citation/2723069/section/2183); [1988] 2 All ER 118 at [122](https://jade.io/citation/2723069/section/140443): _[Wotton](https://jade.io/article/507578)_ at [[1622]](https://jade.io/article/507578/section/62178).
    
- It is convenient to reproduce again the relevant portion of Ms Tickleâs evidence, at [38] of her affidavit:
    
    > The above events involving the Giggle App and Ms Grover have had a significant impact on my life. The respondentsâ unilateral decision that I am not a woman, and therefore cannot access the Giggle App, has upset me greatly and has resulted in me having to go to great lengths to prove that I am a woman. It has been exhausting and draining to do so.
    
- Ms Tickle makes clear that the real injury from her exclusion from the Giggle App was the hurt of not being treated as a woman. Â As I have found, it is most probable that this arose from a reflexive decision by Ms Grover while reviewing Ms Tickleâs selfie.Â  Though it was not established in this case that the decision was made because of Ms Tickleâs gender identity, the condition that users appear to be cisgendered women on Ms Groverâs review of their photos did result in Ms Tickle being treated as a man.Â  The imposed condition was not attuned to distinguish between these groups, therefore causing hurt to MsÂ Tickleâs feelings.
    
- The purpose of the prohibition on discrimination on the ground of gender identity discrimination is to address this kind of injury, among others. On Ms Tickleâs evidence she had made minimal use of the Giggle App before her removal: see [113] above. I accept Ms Groverâs evidence (at [[114]](https://jade.io/article/1087587/section/1642) above) that Ms Tickle had made no interactions or connections with other Giggle App users, and had not made posts or contributions, especially in the absence of any evidence from Ms Tickle that she did so. The material impact of Ms Tickle being denied the Giggle Appâs services has therefore not been proven to be more than minimal. Her contemporaneous conduct, explained by her, is that she had given up using the Giggle App because she had found there were not many users to connect with at the time.
    
- Despite that conclusion, the emotional effects of her gender identity being denied have some significance. She says that this has upset her greatly. However, I am unable to attribute responsibility to the respondents for her finding this, in her words, exhausting and draining, to have to go to great lengths to prove that she is a woman. Overall, Ms Tickleâs evidence as to loss or damage is slight, if not minimal. It does not rise higher than a modest degree of hurt feelings. Taking all of these considerations into account, I find a sufficient basis has been established to make orders for a modest award of compensatory damages.

- Indirect gender identity discrimination has been established and is compensable, but I conclude that it was brought on a point of principle rather than due to any lasting hurt or disadvantage.Â  MsÂ Tickleâs evidence was that she was not really all that interested in actually using the Giggle App.Â  Her evidence went no further than establishing that she wanted the continued ability to access the Giggle App, rather than having any express or implied intention to actually access it or otherwise use it.Â 
    
- As this seems to be the first gender identity discrimination case, there are no prior damage awards to use as any kind of yardstick as to what might be appropriate. I have had regard to the outcomes in a range of other kinds of discrimination cases identified by Mortimer CJ in **_[Kaplan](https://jade.io/article/1046559)_** _[v State of Victoria (No 8)](https://jade.io/article/1046559)_ [2023] FCA 1092 at [[1640]](https://jade.io/article/1046559/section/62196). However, that has not advanced things very much due to the absence of any yardstick basis for the assessment of an appropriate quantum of damages in this specific area. In the absence of any quantifying evidence, this was the widest and most unguided discretion to exercise, not unlike civil penalty imposition or criminal fine imposition for a new area of proscribed conduct.
    
- The features of the conduct that took place have been considered in some detail in these reasons. I am left with an exercise akin to penalty or fine imposition of instinctive synthesis in which there is no single right or wrong figure, there being nothing precise such as proven economic loss. I consider the amount suggested by the respondents to be far too low, and the figures suggested by Ms Tickle to be far too high. After some considerable thought and reflection, I have arrived at the figure of $10,000 in damages. As I note below, there is one limited basis upon which Ms Tickleâs aggravated damages succeeds, but where the harm caused is relatively slight and difficult to quantify: see Part 6(c)(v). The award of damages also reflects that limited aspect of aggravated damages.
    
- This award of $10,000 is more than a nominal sum, but remains modest to reflect the reality of what has taken place, the limited evidence that Ms Tickle chose to adduce and the narrow ambit of the harm that has been shown to have been caused. Given the novelty of this claim, I should note that this quantum does not reflect the potential seriousness of gender identity discrimination that might emerge in another case. This kind of discrimination is just as capable of being as harmful as all other kinds of discrimination listed in the [SDA](https://jade.io/article/219680), and therefore of justifying substantial awards of damages. The quantum in this case reflects the case that was proven. Had the proven facts differed, or the case been focused or run differently, it is possible that a much higher quantum would have been justified.

1. **(c)** **Aggravated damages**
    
    **_(i)_**Â  **_Authority and principles_**
    
2. Next, I turn to the question of aggravated damages. This discussion, and the particular conduct then considered, proceeds upon the basis that conduct which aggravates the conduct falling within the scope of s 46PO(3) is itself within that provision even though it could not have been part of the complaint. Given the conclusions I reach about most aspects of this claim for the reasons given below, the soundness of this assumption does not have to be tested.
    
3. Again, Ms Tickle seeks $100,000, while the respondents oppose any award at all. This ends up turning on the absence of particulars pleaded, the dire shortage of evidence adduced, and the lack of any compelling argument being advanced of there being any relevant aggravation of the proven indirect gender identity discrimination conduct. Whether there was in fact any proper basis for an award of aggravated damages I will never know, because not even a faint glimmer of a proper basis for this was advanced. I am not persuaded that any proper basis for aggravated damages has been established.
    
4. It is well established that aggravated damages may be awarded under s [46PO(4)(d)](https://jade.io/article/218280/section/34856) as they are compensatory, not punitive, in nature: see **_[Elliott v Nanda](https://jade.io/article/103443)_** [2001] FCA 418; (2001) 111 FCR 240 at [[179]-[184]](https://jade.io/article/103443/section/8699) (Moore J); _[Clarke v Nationwide News Pty Ltd](https://jade.io/article/266784)_ [2012] FCA 307; 201 FCR 389 at [[347]](https://jade.io/article/266784/section/9025), [[349]](https://jade.io/article/266784/section/5383) (Barker J); **_[Ewin v Vergara](https://jade.io/article/307076)_** _[(No 3)](https://jade.io/article/307076)_ [2013] FCA 1311; 307 ALR 576 at [[676]](https://jade.io/article/307076/section/31080), [[678]](https://jade.io/article/307076/section/16130) (Bromberg J); _[Wotton](https://jade.io/article/507578)_ at [[1737]](https://jade.io/article/507578/section/62293) (Mortimer J); _[Hughes (t/as Beesley and Hughes Lawyers) v Hill](https://jade.io/article/757299)_ [2020] FCAFC 126; 277 FCR 511 (**_Hughes v Hill_**_)_ at [[61]-[64]](https://jade.io/article/757299/section/2906) (Perram J, Reeves and Collier JJ agreeing); _[Kaplan](https://jade.io/article/1046559)_ at [[1760]-[1763]](https://jade.io/article/1046559/section/1411723) (Mortimer CJ); **_[Taylor](https://jade.io/article/1052324)_** _[v August and Pemberton Pty Ltd](https://jade.io/article/1052324)_ [2023] FCA 1313 at [[523]-[524]](https://jade.io/article/1052324/section/551905) (Katzmann J).
    
5. Ms Tickle seeks those additional damages on the basis of:
    
    > (a)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â the respondentsâ refusal to attend conciliation proceedings held by the AHRC;
    > 
    > (b)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â the respondentsâ refusal to reinstate Ms Tickleâs access after becoming aware that she is a transgender woman following the AHRC complaint;
    > 
    > (c)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a number of public comments made by Ms Grover about Ms Tickle since the filing of her AHRC complaint, amounting to â_a public campaign over two years of persistently belittling Ms Tickle_â, which she claims also caused â_online hate_â from other persons towards her;
    > 
    > (d)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â the respondentsâ refusal to apologise to Ms Tickle; and
    > 
    > (e)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â the respondentsâ conduct at trial, including instructing counsel to plead that Ms Tickle is a man, and to refer to her with male pronouns in written and oral submissions, as well as Ms Grover laughing at a demeaning caricature of Ms Tickle while giving evidence.
    
6. Basis (d) was averted to in Ms Tickleâs amended statement of claim, but was not pressed in her submissions, and there is no evidence of loss or damage that supports it. Basis (c) was not noted as a ground for aggravated damages in her originating application or amended statement of claim, though the respondents raised no objection to it being raised as a ground for aggravated damages in her closing oral submissions.
    
7. Aggravated damages have traditionally been awarded in tort for additional injured feelings of the applicant incurred by the way in which the respondent committed the tort: see, _[Cassell & Co Ltd v Broome](https://jade.io/citation/2807118)_ [1972] AC 1027 at [1124](https://jade.io/citation/2807117/section/3885) (Lord Diplock). They have also been awarded in defamation proceedings on the basis of the way in which the respondent conducted themselves at trial, where that conduct was characterised as not being bona fide, justifiable or proper: **_[Triggell](https://jade.io/article/64729)_** _[v Pheeny](https://jade.io/article/64729)_ (1951) 82 CLR 497 at [514](https://jade.io/article/64729/section/140267) (Dixon, Williams, Webb and Kitto JJ)_._Â  In _[Triggell](https://jade.io/article/64729)_, the High Court upheld a direction by the primary judge that the jury could consider whether the pressing of a defence of truth by the defendant was aggravating in circumstances where it was open to the jury to conclude that the defendant did not honestly believe in that defence: _[Triggell](https://jade.io/article/64729)_ at [515-516](https://jade.io/article/64729/section/3053). Such a stance aggravates the impact of the false defamatory imputation, so is tied to the tortious conduct by that nexus. However, care must be taken in applying tort reasoning to a statutory cause of action.
    
8. Reasoning by analogy with tort, this Court has awarded aggravated damages in several discrimination cases on the basis of the way the respondent conducted themselves at trial, or in the lead up to trial, citing the requirements in _[Triggell](https://jade.io/article/64729)_ at [514](https://jade.io/article/64729/section/140267); see also _[Taylor](https://jade.io/article/1052324)_ at [[524]-[525]](https://jade.io/article/1052324/section/756789) and _Elliot v Nanda_ at 297, [180], [182].Â  Further, _[Hughes v Hill](https://jade.io/article/757299)_, which does not cite _[Triggell](https://jade.io/article/64729)_ directly, at [[61]](https://jade.io/article/64729/section/140807) cites _Ewin v Vergara at_ [678] and _Clarke v Nationwide News_ at [349], both of which cite _Elliot v Nanda_ at 297.
    
9. In _[Elliott v Nanda](https://jade.io/article/103443)_, Moore J was asked to consider whether aggravated damages were available for a respondentâs failure to appear before a hearing of the complaint before the HREOC (as the AHRC was then named), where that failure had delayed resolution of the complaint by a considerable period, resulting in additional stress and mental anguish for the applicant: at [[184]](https://jade.io/article/103443/section/1758). His Honour was satisfied they were, ordering $5,000 in aggravated damages. In coming to this conclusion, Moore J relied on authority from _[Triggell](https://jade.io/article/64729)_ at [514](https://jade.io/article/64729/section/4709), described above, at [[182]](https://jade.io/article/64729/section/4709). His Honour also discussed the wide variety of matters which may ground the decision to award aggravated damages in anti-discrimination law cases, referring to a number of court and tribunal decisions:
    
    > (a)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a Queensland Anti-Discrimination Tribunal decision, _[Whittle v Paulette](https://jade.io/citation/14905376)_ (1994) EOC Â¶92-621, to award $10,000 each to two complainants who had alleged sexual harassment on the part of the first respondent, in contravention of s [119](https://jade.io/article/422498/section/1153) of the _[Anti-Discrimination Act 1991](https://jade.io/article/422498)_ [(Qld)](https://jade.io/article/422498), where the Tribunal had noted that the first respondent was arrogant and aggressive in the witness box and insensitive to the effect of his treatment of the complainants: at 77,306;
    > 
    > (b)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a HREOC decision, where a complainant had claimed aggravated damages in relation to her sexual harassment complaint on the basis that senior staff in her workplace had not taken her complaints seriously. There, the respondent had made several offers of settlement to the complainant, including payment of the costs to date of the proposed settlement, and the applicant had not been required to establish the facts of her alleged sexual harassment or the respondentâs vicarious liability, with the Commission concluding that it should not award aggravated damages: _[Greenhalgh v National Australia Bank Ltd](https://jade.io/citation/15360765)_ (1997) EOC Â¶92-884; and
    > 
    > (c)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a decision of the Queensland Supreme Court to uphold an award of aggravated damages by the Queensland Anti-Discrimination Tribunal in an age discrimination case brought under ss [7(1)(f)](https://jade.io/article/422498/section/21874) and [14(1)(b)](https://jade.io/article/422498/section/3191) of the _[Anti-Discrimination Act 1991](https://jade.io/article/422498)_ [(Qld)](https://jade.io/article/422498), on the basis that the defendantâs method of cross-examination, which involved suggestions that the plaintiff was looking for money because he was out of work, where the applicant had suffered additional distress as a result of the defendantâs method of cross-examination: _[McIntyre v Tully](https://jade.io/citation/1379717)_ (1999) 90 IR 9 (Atkinson J).
    

1. In _[Ewin v Vergara](https://jade.io/article/307076)_, an extreme sexual harassment case brought under the [SDA](https://jade.io/article/219680) resulting in a large award of damages, the applicant sought aggravated damages, claiming that there was always going to be a component in a case like that in which general damages in the discretion would not sufficiently compensate â_the horror, the dislocation, the disruption of life, the smell of flashbacks, the suicide attempts, the change in lifestyle_â: at [[677]](https://jade.io/article/1087587/section/34544). Bromberg J considered that aggravated damages were compensatory in nature and therefore available under s [46PO(4)(d)](https://jade.io/article/218280/section/34856), and that they could be available in circumstances where a respondent had increased the hurt to the applicant through their conduct of proceedings: at [678]. However, his Honour found that the grounds on which aggravated damages were sought were already reflected in general damages awarded, declining to award aggravated damages on the basis it would amount to double dipping for the applicant: at [[678]](https://jade.io/article/1087587/section/16130). It follows that even serious conduct causing substantial hurt will not necessarily result in the awarding of aggravated damages.
    
2. In _[Wotton](https://jade.io/article/507578)_, Mortimer J (as the Chief Justice then was) considered whether aggravated damages were available where contraventions of s 9(1) of the _Racial Discrimination Act 1957_ (Cth) (**RDA**) had been made out. Her Honour noted that the weight of authority supported the view that awards of aggravated damages were available under s [46PO(4)](https://jade.io/article/218280/section/7144) as they serve a compensatory purpose (at [1737]), but dismissed the claim on bases that are not relevant to the current proceeding.
    
3. In Mortimer Jâs discussion of the availability of aggravated damages in _[Wotton](https://jade.io/article/507578)_, her Honour noted that in some cases, the aggravation comes not from conduct directly associated with or following on from the contravening conduct, but from subsequent conduct that has the same effect: [1733].Â  In oral submissions in this proceeding, MsÂ Tickle relied on that statement (as quoted in _[Kaplan](https://jade.io/article/1046559)_ at [[1762]](https://jade.io/article/1046559/section/62318)) as authority for the general proposition that courts may award an applicant aggravated damages under s [46PO(4)(d)](https://jade.io/article/218280/section/34856) based on a respondentâs conduct subsequent to the filing of an AHRC complaint. I do not read that statement in _[Wotton](https://jade.io/article/507578)_ as going that far. Â The rest of the paragraph goes on to cite, as examples of the proposition, _[Elliott v Nanda](https://jade.io/article/103443)_ (see above) and _[Houda v New South Wales](https://jade.io/article/134124)_ [2005] NSWSC 1053, both cases in which aggravated damages were awarded on the basis of the way in which the respondents conducted their part of the proceeding. I read the statement above as going no further than either authority cited. That conclusion is fortified by the fact that the present question of whether aggravated damages were available for conduct subsequent to the AHRC complaint was not live in _[Wotton](https://jade.io/article/507578)_.
    
4. In _[Hughes v Hill](https://jade.io/article/757299)_, the Full Court upheld an award of aggravated damages by the primary judge in a sexual harassment claim: at [[59]](https://jade.io/article/757299/section/140578) (Perram J, Reeves and Collier JJ agreeing). Aggravated damages had been awarded to reflect the additional harm from threats made by the appellant to prevent the respondent complaining of sexual harassment, and the manner in which he conducted his defence at trial, which included blaming the respondent for his conduct due to her manner of dress and alleging she had been sexually abused as a child in order to blacken her name: at [54]-[64].
    
5. In _[Kaplan](https://jade.io/article/1046559)_, Mortimer CJ affirmed the proposition that aggravated damages were available under s [46PO(4)](https://jade.io/article/218280/section/7144) where racial discrimination under s 9(1) of the RDA had been made out: at [1759]-[1789]. The proceeding involved findings that a state school principal had failed to take steps to address high levels of antisemitic bullying. Aggravated damages were awarded to one of the applicants, a former student, for the school principalâs failure to take steps to ensure his safety following an assault at a park, which was found to have increased the applicantâs hurt: at [1787]-[1789], citing _[New South Wales v](https://jade.io/article/3445) **[Ibbett](https://jade.io/article/3445)**_ [2006] HCA 57; 229 CLR 638 at [[35]](https://jade.io/article/3445/section/140690). The cited portion of _[Ibbett](https://jade.io/article/3445)_, for completeness, is authority for no more than the orthodox proposition that, where the conduct giving rise to a tort increases the hurt to the subject of the tort, aggravated damages may be available. _[Kaplan](https://jade.io/article/1046559)_ does not state whether the principalâs failures were included in, or occurred after the lodging of, the complaint to the AHRC that gave rise to the proceeding.
    
6. _[Taylor](https://jade.io/article/1052324)_ involved successful claims by the applicant of sexual harassment and victimisation by the respondent, in contravention of ss [28B(2)](https://jade.io/article/219680/section/49631) and [94](https://jade.io/article/219680/section/566) of the [SDA](https://jade.io/article/219680), as well as breach of the applicantâs employment contract. Katzmann J considered that it was well established that s [46PO(4)](https://jade.io/article/218280/section/7144) empowered the Court to make awards of aggravated damages, citing _[Hall v A & A Sheiban Pty Ltd](https://jade.io/article/150883)_ (1989) 20 FCR 217 at [23-40](https://jade.io/article/150883/section/1411724) (Lockhart J) and [282](https://jade.io/article/150883/section/140784) (French J), _[Ewin v Vergara](https://jade.io/article/307076)_ and _[Hughes v Hill](https://jade.io/article/757299)_: at [[526]](https://jade.io/article/757299/section/24354). Her Honour noted that aggravated damages could be awarded to an applicant whose distress was made worse by the respondentsâ conduct after the wrongful act or acts are committed, and where that conduct was improper, unjustifiable or lacking in bona fides: at [524]-[525], citing _[Triggell](https://jade.io/article/64729)_ at [514.](https://jade.io/article/64729/section/140267) Like Mortimer Jâs statement in _[Wotton](https://jade.io/article/507578)_, I read that statement as going no further than the authority cited, which provides only that an award of aggravated damages may be available for a respondentâs conduct in the proceeding (which has already been taken into account in relation to general damages). That is fortified by the nature of the award of aggravated damages in that proceeding, which was made on the basis of the respondentâs intimidatory and unjustified legal response to the applicantâs AHRC complaint, which included a suggestion that the applicant had manipulated and been flirtatious with the respondent: at [[537]-[539]](https://jade.io/article/507578/section/1411725).
    
7. What is really notable about all of the cases discussed above is that they are a far cry from what has happened to Ms Tickle. As considered below, no real attempt was made to marry the conduct relied upon for aggravated damages to the conduct relied upon to establish unlawful discrimination. In light of that, two further observations may be made about awards of aggravated damages in discrimination proceedings.
    
8. The first observation is that aggravated damages are not an unbounded path to seeking compensation for all harmful conduct by the respondents that falls outside the proceeding that has been brought, even if peripherally related to them. There must be some kind of nexus between the unlawful discrimination and the further hurt arising from that discrimination for which the aggravated damages further compensates. That nexus will be clearest where the further hurt arises from the way in which the unlawful discrimination occurred.
    
9. The nexus may arise because the actions of the respondent at trial, or perhaps in relation to the conduct of proceedings (see _[Taylor](https://jade.io/article/1052324)_, especially at [[538]-[539]](https://jade.io/article/1052324/section/1121056)), cause further harm to the applicant. In _[Taylor](https://jade.io/article/1052324)_, which involved sexual harassment and victimisation claims brought under the [SDA](https://jade.io/article/219680), aggravated damages were awarded on the basis of improper, unjustifiable and non-bona fide accusations by the respondent against the complainant in the course of the trial and in letters from the respondentâs solicitors to the complainantâs solicitors: at [525], [538]-[539]; see also the Full Courtâs upholding of aggravated damages in similar circumstances in _[Hughes v Hill](https://jade.io/article/757299)_ at [[57]-[64]](https://jade.io/article/757299/section/9462). Those accusations bear a clear link to the nature of the unlawful discrimination found.
    
10. The second observation is that it remains unclear how s 46PO(3), which requires unlawful discrimination alleged in applications to this Court to be the same as, or in substance the same as, those contained in the applicantâs original complaint to the AHRC, affects the award of damages founded on conduct that occurred subsequently to the filing of the AHRC complaint. As noted above, the Courtâs power to award compensatory damages is statutory, created by s [46PO(4)(d)](https://jade.io/article/218280/section/34856) which allows an award of damages to be made only where the Court has found unlawful discrimination, as limited by s 46PO(3). None of the authorities in which aggravated damages have been awarded have addressed that question. Neither party provided submissions related to that question.
    
11. I draw from the authorities a number of minimum threshold requirements before the present claim for aggravated damages could be entertained. **There would need to be:**
    
    > **(a)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a compelling evidentiary basis for attributing the conduct said to give rise to the claim for aggravated damages to either or both respondents;**
    > 
    > **(b)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a clear nexus between that conduct and this proceeding, which in turn must be tethered to the complaint to the AHRC which gives rise to this Courtâs jurisdiction; and**Â 
    > 
    > **(c)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â clear evidence of separate or additional harm caused by that conduct.**
    
12. In this case, **none of those three criteria are met**, any one of which failure would be fatal to the claim for aggravated damages. Moreover, as detailed below, the paucity of the evidence chosen to be advanced by Ms Tickle ended up making this proceeding a poor vehicle to question the outer bounds of the Courtâs power to award damages for subsequent conduct under s [46PO(4)(d)](https://jade.io/article/218280/section/34856). Each aspect of the claim for aggravated damages is addressed below.
