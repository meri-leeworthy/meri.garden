- Complaint of discrimination being told he looked like a gorilla and was accused of being homosexual: [16], [94]-[95]. It was alleged this led Jemal  to feel isolated in his work environment: [22], [95].
- Jemal alleged that “employees of ISS acted in a way such that he was treated unfavourably because of his race and disability. He also alleged victimization”: [1]
- He was asked to undertake tasks outside of his job description and alleged both threats and racial slurs and pressure to resign: [16]
- Of these allegations, it was found that the issues arising from the comments of looking like a gorilla, accusations of being homosexual, issues with the provision of inadequate uniform and loss of contract at ISS constituted discrimination on the basis of race. The other allegations were mere unfavourable treatment: [115]-[116].
- The claim as to victimization was denied: [143]
- Court guided by _Richardson v Oracle_ [2014] FCAFC 82 at 108 in which  Kenny J said that “community standards now accord a higher value  compensation for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment than before”,  which was found to apply beyond sexual harassment claims: [172]-[173]
- Compensation only awarded for 1 instance of the alleged discrimination  (comments of looking like a gorilla and accusations of being homosexual)  as this was the only instance which satisfied the causal link and there was  no medical or psychological evidence as to the impact on Jemal: [174]

Jemal v Iss Facility Services Pty Ltd (Human Rights) [2015] VCAT 103  

## R Phillips Member.

Background

[1]  This case involves allegations about the conduct of various employees of ISS Facility Services Pty Ltd (ISS). Mr Jemal (the applicant) alleges that employees of ISS acted in a way such that he was treated unfavourably because of his race and disability. He also alleged victimisation.

[2]  Mr Jemal was born in Ethiopia. He claimed that his disability was thyroydism.

[3]  He has been employed at ISS since February 2006 as a security officer.

[4]  During this period he has worked at various locations. He has previously made complaints about his treatment by other employees. A complaint was lodged with the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission (the Commission) in June 2010 in relation to allegations of discrimination and victimisation between 2008 and 2010.

[5]  The Commission investigated this complaint and conciliation was attempted but was ultimately unsuccessful. Accordingly, the Commission wrote to Mr Jemal on 17 January 2011 advising that it would dismiss the complaint if Mr Jemal did not request a referral to this Tribunal.

[6]  Mr Jemal did not request this referral and in a letter dated 13 May 2011 the Commission dismissed his complaint.

[7]  Mr Jemal made a further complaint to the Commission in August 2012. The issues raised related to salary, roster, overtime and working conditions. Conciliation was again unsuccessful and the Commission closed its file in July 2013.

[8]  Mr Jemal then lodged an application with the Tribunal in December 2013 which he amended in March 2014. In his application he referred to a series of events between 14 September 2011 and 14 November 2013 and sought unspecified reimbursement of medical expenses, discrepancies in wages and a full investigation of his complaint.

[9]  I heard the matter on 21, 22 October and 8 December 2014.

[10]  After hearing evidence and submissions from both parties, I reserved my decision.

[11]  These are the reasons for my decision.

...

[168]  Whilst it could well be argued that the stress suffered by Mr Jemal can be attributed to a range of factors, as stated above, there is authority to support the conclusion that it is sufficient that a contravention of the EO Act is a cause of the loss or damage. I am satisfied that this is the case in these circumstances.

[169]  Mr Jemal maintains that the conduct of ISS has impacted his health and that he felt humiliated and isolated as a result of the discrimination. As previously stated, what is more difficult to assess is the degree of this impact on Mr Jemal.

[170]  ISS asserted that if an award for compensation was made, it should be at the lower end of the scale. No submissions were made about what the scale was.

[171]  I note the following comments made by the Tribunal in 2012 when assessing hurt and humiliation.

> The starting position in relation to awards for prohibited discrimination for injury to feelings (also referred to as non-economic loss), is that the amount should not be minimal, as that would trivialise or diminish respect for the public policy to which the Equal Opportunity Act gives effect. On the other hand, awards ought not be excessive, as that would also damage respect for that public policy.[xiii](https://plus.lexis.com/apac/document/?pdmfid=1539278&crid=aa0dc248-e636-47f7-9b43-fc8cc731d8b4&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases-au%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5FTV-WVM1-JJSF-24NP-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=267716&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&prid=967fa060-8ea9-4af3-b291-f84472c715af&ecomp=s85k&earg=sr21#)

[172]  In the recent Federal Court case of Richardson v Oracle, Kenny J noted as follows: “… community standards now accord a higher value compensation for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment than before.“[xiv](https://plus.lexis.com/apac/document/?pdmfid=1539278&crid=aa0dc248-e636-47f7-9b43-fc8cc731d8b4&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases-au%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5FTV-WVM1-JJSF-24NP-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=267716&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&prid=967fa060-8ea9-4af3-b291-f84472c715af&ecomp=s85k&earg=sr21#)

[173]  While this case related to claims of sexual harassment, Kenny J did note that the principle has broader application.[xv](https://plus.lexis.com/apac/document/?pdmfid=1539278&crid=aa0dc248-e636-47f7-9b43-fc8cc731d8b4&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases-au%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5FTV-WVM1-JJSF-24NP-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=267716&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&prid=967fa060-8ea9-4af3-b291-f84472c715af&ecomp=s85k&earg=sr21#)

[174]  In assessing the amount of compensation I have taken into account that the compensation is for one of the seventeen alleged incidents, Mr Jemal’s evidence in relation to the effect of incidents over a period of time, the lack of medical and psychological evidence in relation to the impact on Mr Jemal, the relevant case law and the circumstances in this case. I will therefore set the appropriate amount of compensation at $3,000.

## Order

Order the Respondent to pay the Applicant the sum of $3,000.
