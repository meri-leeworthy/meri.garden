> Fernando Flores has had experience with social and political organization at the highest level of government, in his posts as director of the state-owned corporations, Minister of Economics, and Minister of Finance in the government of Salvador Allende in Chile between 1970 and 1973. He was instrumental in a large-scale project to apply cybernetic theory to practical management problems (see Beer, Platform for Change, 1975) and is primarily interested in the understanding of social reality that we can gain through combining theory and practice.
