- Applicant alleged discrimination under s 18C of the RDA: [3]-[4] (being “distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on the applicant’s race, colour, national or ethnic origin which nullified or impaired the  applicant’s enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing of the human right,  namely, his participation in the workplace without suffering discrimination 

or the fear of it or to participate within society without discrimination or fear  of it”)

- Applicant relied on evidence of two medical practitioners: [22] (a consultant psychiatrist and an independent medical practitioner)
- Applicant sought damages for pain, suffering, distress and humiliation in  the sum of $100,000, together with aggravated damages of $100,000 and an apology in unqualified terms: [52]. Exemplary damages were pleaded in the alternative: [56].

- Aggravated damages denied primarily because the applicant should have acted more promptly to lessen the damage and would otherwise constitute “double dipping”: [81]
- Exemplary damages were denied because the complained conduct did not warrant punitive (as opposed to compensatory) damages: [83]
- Apology denied because no evidence an apology would compensate the applicant: [84]

- At [62], cited _Richardson_ _v_ _Oracle_ _Corporation_ _Australia_ _Pty_ _Limited_ (2014) 223 FCR 334 for the principle that damages are only available to compensate the applicant for the loss actually sustained “because of” the defendants’ conduct: [62]-[63]. The assault must have been “occasioned

by discriminatory motivation”: [64]
