## *Radical Interdependence, Autonomy, and the Making of Worlds*

## Arturo Escobar

**To Bob Marley, a prophet of our times**

**To the Zapatistas of Chiapas, for their pluriversal imagination**

**To the indigenous, Afrodescendant, and peasant communities of the Norte del Cauca region of Colombia, for their steadfast determination to defend the tejido de la vida (the relational weave of life) against rampant destruction by modern worlds.**
