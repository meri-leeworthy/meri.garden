Mass surveillance in Australia has been an ongoing and controversial topic, especially with the increasing reliance on digital technologies and national security concerns. Key aspects of mass surveillance in Australia include:

1. **[[Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979]]**: This allows law enforcement agencies to access private communications, such as phone calls and emails, with a warrant. The act has been expanded over time to adapt to new technologies, including internet communications.

2. **[[Data Retention Scheme]]**: In 2015, Australia introduced mandatory data retention laws requiring telecommunication companies to store metadata (such as call logs, IP addresses, and location data) for two years. This data is accessible to law enforcement and intelligence agencies without a warrant, raising concerns about privacy and potential abuse.

3. **[[Australian Signals Directorate (ASD)]]**: The ASD is responsible for foreign signals intelligence, but recent legal adjustments allow it to support domestic law enforcement in matters involving cybersecurity and national security. This raises questions about the overlap between foreign and domestic surveillance.

4. **Encryption and the [Assistance and Access Act 2018](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about-us/our-portfolios/national-security/lawful-access-telecommunications/data-encryption)**: Known as the "anti-encryption law," this act compels tech companies to provide law enforcement with access to encrypted communications upon request. This has raised concerns among privacy advocates, tech companies, and civil rights groups, arguing that it undermines secure communication.

5. **Facial Recognition and Biometric Surveillance**: Australia has been expanding its biometric surveillance capabilities, including the implementation of a national facial recognition database called the National Facial Biometric Matching Capability. Itâ€™s intended to be used for identity verification across multiple government agencies, but critics worry about its potential misuse.

6. **International Partnerships**: Australia is part of the "[[Five Eyes]]" intelligence alliance, which includes the US, UK, Canada, and New Zealand. This alliance involves extensive sharing of intelligence, including surveillance data, among member countries.

Privacy advocates, civil liberties groups, and some political figures argue that these measures represent an overreach of government power, eroding individual freedoms. On the other hand, proponents argue that these are necessary tools to counter terrorism, cybercrime, and other threats to national security.
