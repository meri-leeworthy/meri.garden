- Smith FM found that the applicant was discriminated against on the basis  of her sex when an employee of the respondent employer had referred to  the applicant’s gender in derogatory and insulting terms.
- She was awarded total compensation of $2,000 (inclusive of costs) on the basis that a significant part of her mental distress in attempting to resolve her complaint against the respondent could not be attributed to the

employee’s remarks about her gender.
