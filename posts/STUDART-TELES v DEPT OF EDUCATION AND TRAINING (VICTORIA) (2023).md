THE DISPUTE

[1]  A spinal stroke in November 2018 caused the applicant, Mr Joao Studart-Teles, severe physical symptoms requiring many months to recover. He expected to return to his work as an experienced language teacher at Blackburn English Language School (‘BELS’) at the start of 2020, with a gradual return to work plan at the school where he had worked since 2008. Just before the start of first term, the principal of the school informed the applicant’s occupational rehabilitation provider that the return to work plan was ‘not supported’ at the school. The principal directed Mr Studart-Teles to remain on unpaid leave.

[2]  Two years of unpaid leave followed. Then, another plan was put in place and the applicant returned to work. After two weeks, he ceased working and remains on unpaid leave.

[3]  The applicant claims that his exclusion from work at the start of 2020 was direct discrimination against him on the basis of his physical disability and a failure by the respondent to make reasonable adjustments for that disability, all in breach of the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Vic) (‘EO Act’), entitling him to compensation for loss, damage and injury.

[4]  Further, the applicant claims that the injury made it difficult for him to return to work. He says that on his return to work in early 2022, the respondent (the government department which operates BELS), again in breach of the EO Act, failed to make reasonable adjustments for his disability, which he says by then included a mental disorder which had developed or been exacerbated as a result of his two-year exclusion from his workplace.

[5]  The applicant seeks compensation for economic and non-economic loss, a declaration that the respondent has contravened the EO Act and an apology.

[6]  The respondent denies any unlawful discrimination or failure to make reasonable adjustments.
