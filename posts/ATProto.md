[[Bluesky and the AT Protocol - Usable Decentralized Social Media]]



[[Merkle Search Tree]]
### In ATProto, what are MSTs used for?

#### 1. **Representing Repos**

Each ATProto user has a personal **repo**, a log of their content (posts, profile info, likes, etc.). This repo is:

- An append-only **log of commits**
    
- Where each **commit contains a root hash of the MST**
    

So the MST represents the **current state of the repo**, mapping keys like:

```
app.bsky.feed.post/3jkxga4k3...
app.bsky.actor.profile/self
```

to content records.

#### 2. **Efficient Sync**

When two peers (or a client and PDS) want to sync:

- They compare **MST root hashes**
- If different, they do a **tree walk**, comparing child hashes to identify differences
- Only changed subtrees or records are transferred

This is **much faster and lighter** than sending full snapshots.

#### 3. **Inclusion Proofs**

Because the MST is a Merkle tree, you can do:

- **Proofs of inclusion** (e.g. "This post exists in the repo at this commit")
- **Proofs of non-inclusion** (e.g. "No record exists at this key")

This is critical for **verifiable data hosting**, especially if PDSs or clients don't trust each other fully.

---

### üß† Implementation Details

- Keys in the tree are **lexicographically ordered strings** (like `"app.bsky.feed.post/..."`)
- Under the hood, it uses a **binary search tree with hash links**, not a trie or flat Merkle tree
- The hashing is **content-addressed**, using [CID-style hashes](https://github.com/multiformats/cid)

---

### üß™ Practical Example

When you post something:

1. The post is assigned a URI like: `at://did:plc:xyz/app.bsky.feed.post/abc123`
2. A record is created and added to the repo
3. The MST is updated to include this new key
4. A new commit is created with a pointer to the new MST root
5. The commit is pushed to your PDS or other peers

> [!Q]
> is this taking into account changes as of sync v1.1 https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0006-sync-iteration ?

Good catch. The explanation I gave was mostly based on **Sync v1**. The new [**Sync v1.1 proposal**](https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0006-sync-iteration) (from the ATProto proposal repo) **does change the role of Merkle Search Trees** in a few key ways. Here's a concise breakdown of what **has changed** and what remains:

---

### üîß What's changed in Sync v1.1 (ATProto Proposal 0006)?

#### 1. ==**MSTs are no longer used for sync diffs**==

- **Before (v1.0):** Diffing between commits was done by comparing MSTs.
- **Now (v1.1):** Sync diffs use a **CAR file stream** based on **causal ordering of writes**, not tree diffs.
- The MST still exists, but it‚Äôs no longer the main mechanism for sync.

> **Quote from proposal:**  
> ‚ÄúRather than performing a diff between MSTs, we instead stream the log of records, with the minimal set of records needed to represent the difference between two commits.‚Äù

#### 2. **Sync now uses a new `syncGetRepoUpdates` endpoint**

- This streams all changes between two commit CIDs.
- Records are streamed in **causal (topological) order**, not sorted by key.
- This allows efficient reconstruction of state **without relying on tree diffs**.

#### 3. **No longer strictly ordering by key**

- Previously, MSTs enforced strict key ordering, which was baked into the sync logic.
- With v1.1, ordering by key is no longer central‚Äîordering is instead by **record write order** (commit history).

---

### ü™µ So what‚Äôs the role of MSTs now?

#### ‚úÖ Still used:

- **As a content-addressable map** in each commit
- For **verifying the state of a repo** at a commit
- For **inclusion/exclusion proofs** (e.g. proving "this key existed at this commit")

#### ‚ùå No longer used:

- For **sync diffing** between commits
- For **generating record streams**

---

### üß† Summary of Sync v1.1 Changes

|Feature|Sync v1|Sync v1.1|
|---|---|---|
|Sync diffing|MST diff|Causal stream of records|
|Ordering|By key|By causal write order|
|Inclusion proofs|MST-based|Still MST-based|
|State verification|MST root hash in commit|Still true|
|Key data structure|MST|Still used, but not for syncing|

---

### üí° Implication

If you're building anything that **consumes or syncs repos**:

- You should implement or expect the new streaming sync model
- But **MSTs still matter** for verifying data integrity, or for doing repo "audits"

Let me know if you want help parsing the `syncGetRepoUpdates` implementation or wiring it up to a CAR file stream parser.


> [!NOTE] Q
> and the streaming is from PDSs, right? is this endpoint defined on the PDS?

Yes ‚Äî the `syncGetRepoUpdates` endpoint is implemented on the **PDS** (Personal Data Server).

### ‚úÖ Confirmed in Sync v1.1

The `syncGetRepoUpdates` endpoint:

- **Is served by PDSs**.
    
- Replaces the need for clients or other PDSs to walk MSTs for diffs.
    
- Streams changes (records and their metadata) between two commits in a DAG, using **causal order**.
    

> **From the spec** ([proposal 0006](https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/blob/main/0006-sync-iteration.md)):  
> _"The PDS exposes a syncGetRepoUpdates endpoint that streams a minimal CAR file representing the causal difference between two commits."_

This means:

- Clients (or other PDSs) send a request like:
    
    ```
    GET /xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getRepoUpdates?did=...&from=...&to=...
    ```
    
- The response is a **CAR stream** (Content Addressable aRchive format), representing just the diffs.
    
- The sync logic is now **simpler**, requiring only commit DAG traversal and CAR parsing, not tree diffing.
    

---

### üß± So in short:

|Component|Role|
|---|---|
|`syncGetRepoUpdates`|XRPC method defined on **PDS**|
|Response|CAR stream of DAG nodes (records, blocks)|
|Diffing logic|Moved from client-side MST diffing ‚Üí to causal commit traversal in the PDS|
|MST|Still in each commit (for verifiability), but **not used for diffing**|

If you're writing a sync client or mirror service, you now primarily need to:

1. Track heads (commit CIDs),
    
2. Call `syncGetRepoUpdates`,
    
3. Parse the returned CAR file and apply changes.
    

Let me know if you want an example of using this endpoint or building a minimal sync client.


> [!NOTE] Q
> and how do they calculate the set difference?


Great question ‚Äî calculating the **set difference** (i.e. "what changed between commit A and commit B?") in **Sync v1.1** no longer involves walking Merkle Search Trees. Instead, it's done by **traversing the commit DAG** between the two commits.

Here's how the PDS calculates the difference:

---

### üîÅ How the PDS Calculates the Set Difference

Given two commit CIDs: `from` and `to`, the PDS:

1. **Finds the common ancestor commit** of `from` and `to` in the repo's DAG.
    
    - The repo is a **causal DAG** (similar to Git's commit graph).
        
    - Finding the ancestor is similar to a **lowest common ancestor** problem.
        
2. **Traverses the DAG forward** from the ancestor to `to`.
    
    - This traversal gives a **topological order of all commits** that occurred after the ancestor.
        
    - This guarantees **causal ordering** of record mutations.
        
3. **Accumulates record-level changes** from those commits.
    
    - Each commit contains a set of **record mutations** (creates, updates, deletes).
        
    - These are bundled into a CAR file stream in the correct order.
        
4. **Returns a CAR stream** that:
    
    - Includes the blocks (records, commits) needed to reconstruct the repo state at `to`,
        
    - But **only includes the minimal necessary changes** from `from` to `to`.
        

---

### üß± Data involved

Each commit block contains:

- The commit metadata (author, timestamp, prev CID)
    
- The CID of the **new MST root** (for integrity)
    
- A list of **record mutations** (key + op + CID)
    

These mutations are used to build the final stream of changes.

---

### üí° So the "set difference" is:

- Not a set difference of **keys in a tree**, like before
    
- It's a difference in **record mutations** across commits between two points in the DAG
    

---

### üß™ Example

Say we have:

```
A --- B --- C --- D
           \
            E --- F
```

If you request updates from `C` to `F`:

- The PDS finds `C` as the ancestor
    
- It walks the path `C ‚Üí E ‚Üí F`
    
- It accumulates record mutations from those commits
    
- It packages the result into a CAR stream and returns that
    

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Bonus: Why this is better than MST diffing

- Works for **non-linear histories** (e.g. forks and merges)
    
- Preserves **record mutation order**
    
- Avoids needing to compare record keys directly
    
- More efficient and less stateful for clients
    

---

Let me know if you want a diagram or code walkthrough of this traversal logic ‚Äî it‚Äôs conceptually close to a topological sort on a DAG plus collecting node payloads.
