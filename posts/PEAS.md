In the context of Artificial Intelligence, PEAS stands for **Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, and Sensors**. It is a framework used to define the task environment of an intelligent agent. Here's a breakdown of each component:

1. **Performance measure**: This defines the criteria for success. It quantifies how well the agent is performing its tasks. For example, in a self-driving car, the performance measure might include safety, speed, and passenger comfort.

2. **Environment**: This describes the world in which the agent operates. It includes everything the agent interacts with, such as other agents, objects, and conditions. For a self-driving car, the environment would include roads, traffic signals, other vehicles, pedestrians, and weather conditions.

3. **Actuators**: These are the mechanisms through which the agent affects the environment. In a self-driving car, actuators would include the steering wheel, accelerator, brakes, and indicators.

4. **Sensors**: These are the devices the agent uses to perceive its environment. For a self-driving car, sensors would include cameras, LIDAR, radar, GPS, and speedometers.

By clearly defining the PEAS components for an AI system, developers can better design, implement, and evaluate intelligent agents.
