[1]  On 25 January 2013, Mr Dirckze enrolled to undertake the Diploma of Nursing (Enrolled Nursing) (the diploma) at the Moorabbin campus of Holmesglen Institute (Holmesglen).

[2]  Between August 2013 and May 2014, Mr Dirckze made complaints to Holmesglen about a range of matters, particularly about exam results and other assessments.

[3]  On 23 May 2014, Mr Dirckze was suspended from attending Holmesglen and on 29 May 2014, he was expelled. Mr Dirckze appealed that decision to the Student Discipline Appeals Committee. On 30 July 2014, the expulsion decision was confirmed.

[4]  On 22 October 2014, Mr Dirckze made an application to the tribunal alleging that he had been discriminated against by Holmesglen in respect of education and the provision of services based on age, employment activity, industrial activity, physical features, political belief or activity, race,[1](https://plus.lexis.com/apac/document/?pdmfid=1539278&crid=d26e2a41-9229-4cd1-bfc6-e9618d545030&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases-au%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A6898-BFP1-JG02-S4N9-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=267716&pdteaserkey=&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&ecomp=s85k&earg=sr14&prid=b3fc14d6-df07-4114-8a35-376960df48d8#) religious belief or activity and sex. He also complained that he had been victimised and sexually harassed. Mr Dirckze added a claim that he had been discriminated against based on a presumed disability. The hearing of the application proceeded on the basis that Mr Dirckze claimed he had been discriminated against because of his age, physical features, race, sex and a presumed disability.

[5]  Mr Dirckze is 42 years of age and is male. The physical features he relies on are his hair loss and the fact that, from time to time, he had dyed his dark coloured hair blonde. Mr Dirckze has dark brown skin and says that he was called ‘a monkey’. He complains that is a racist remark. In late 2013, Mr Dirckze was required by Holmesglen to have an assessment of his mental state. He says that action amounts to discrimination based on a presumed disability. Mr Dirckze says he was discriminated against and victimised when he was expelled.

[6]  The other claims arise from Mr Dirckze having failed subjects, been excluded from participation in practical components of the diploma and from things Mr Dirckze says were said and done in meetings and interactions with Holmesglen staff. The sexual harassment allegations also arise in the context of meetings and interactions with certain Holmesglen staff. Mr Dirckze says that much of his treatment amounts to victimisation as a consequence of complaints he made about his treatment and about the manner in which Holmesglen is run.

[7]  Mr Dirckze’s claims are made under the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Vic) (EO Act).

[8]  Holmesglen denies all of these allegations. It says it appropriately applied its policies regarding academic progress to Mr Dirckze and that it offered him appropriate support from time to time. It says that he failed exams, not because of any attribute protected by the EO Act, but because his academic performance was not adequate. Holmesglen relies on Mr Dirckze’s behaviour as the basis on which he was expelled. It follows that Holmesglen denies there was any victimisation of Mr Dirckze. The relevant staff deny the alleged acts of sexual harassment.

[9]  Section 109 of the EO Act provides that, if a person, in the course of their employment, engages in conduct such as discrimination, sexual harassment or victimisation, both the person and the employer may be liable. Section 110 sets out an exception to the application of section 109. Mr Dirckze has brought his claim against Holmesglen only and it has not denied it may be liable for acts of its employees which breach of the EO Act.

[10]  Mr Dirckze’s claims include complaints about the conduct of various students at Holmesglen. Following discussion at the hearing, he understood that Holmesglen was not legally responsible for the actions of his fellow students and that those matters would not be considered in this proceeding. His materials also raise complaints about compliance with ethical and regulatory requirements. Those matters have not been considered other than to the extent they may be relevant to the EO Act claims.

[11]  Having heard evidence from Mr Dirckze and seven Holmesglen staff and reviewed a large number of documents, I am satisfied that Mr Dirckze has proven one of his claims but that the remainder are to be dismissed. I have found that one instance of racial discrimination has been proven and so have made an award of compensation in respect of that matter. I will first address the law under which the claims are made and then turn to the substance of the allegations.
## Order

- 1. Under section 125(a)(ii) of the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Vic) (EO Act), the Tribunal finds the claim of discrimination on the basis of race in circumstances where Mr Dirckze was compared to a monkey proven and a breach of Part 4 of the EO Act. The Tribunal orders that Holmesglen Institute pay Mr Dirckze the sum of $3,000 within 30 days.
- 2. Under section 125(c)(ii) of the EO Act, the Tribunal finds all other claims are not proven and so there has been no contravention of Part 4, 6 or 7 of the EO Act. Accordingly, the Tribunal orders that all other claims are dismissed.
