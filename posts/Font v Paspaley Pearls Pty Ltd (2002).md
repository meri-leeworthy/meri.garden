- It was held that the applicant had been the victim of sexual harassment  and discrimination in the course of her employment in the respondent’s  jewellery store.
- In addition to $7,500 in exemplary damages awarded for the ‘unjustifiable and inappropriate’ manner in which the respondents had conducted aspects of the proceedings, Raphael FM awarded the applicant the amount of $10,000 as general damages.

- In arriving at that figure, his Honour had regard to a schedule of damages  awarded during the period HREOC had its hearing function and to decisions of the FMC. His Honour also noted that he had borne in mind ‘what I regard to be a serious failure of the first respondent to put in place

any appropriate machinery for dealing with this type of complaint’.
