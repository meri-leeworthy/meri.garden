#### 1.6. Multiplication rule (independent event)

If an event is the intersection of two other events, events A and B must occur simultaneously. Then the multiplication rule is used.

$$ 𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵)=𝑃(𝐴)×𝑃(𝐵) $$

#### Multiplication rule (dependent event)

If the two events need to occur, but the latter event depends on the prior event, then the following rule applies.

$$𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵)=𝑃(𝐴)×𝑃(𝐵|𝐴)$$
