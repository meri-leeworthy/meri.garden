- Complaint of sexual harassment and sex discrimination. The complainant was 16 years old and in the first weeks of her first job as a sales assistant and kitchen hand at a roast chicken shop. The complainant alleged her 40 year-old employer made inappropriate sexual comments about her body,  made sexual advances on her, kissed her against her will and requested  sexual favours from her.
- The complainant provided evidence about the effects this conduct had on  her from her family doctor, a qualified social worker, a sexual assault  counsellor and a consultant psychiatrist. VCAT was satisfied the  complainant had suffered an ongoing adjustment disorder, with associated  anxiety, hurt and humiliation.
- It accepted the complainant had been unable to work for periods of time because of this disorder, as a direct result of the conduct. VCAT considered the power imbalance between the complainant and the employer, and the employer's intimidation and oppressive behaviour  towards the complainant, was of particular importance: at [50].

- **VCAT ordered $25,000 in general damages, $3617.60 in special  damages (loss of earnings) and $871.50 for medical expenses. VCAT  also ordered the respondents pay the complainant's costs for one day's hearing on County Court Scale A to be taxed in default of agreement.**
