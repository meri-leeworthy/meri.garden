BACKGROUND

[1]  NLD, the complainant, experienced a sexual assault, a rape, in 1997. In 2021, child protection officers of the Department of Families Fairness and Housing (the department) wrote a child protection report about NLD’s granddaughter. The report mentioned NLD’s historic experience of sexual assault. As required by the Children Youth and Families Act2005 (Vic) (CYF Act) the child protection report was sent to NLD’s daughter (mother of the child said to be in need of protection) and to the father of the child and their lawyers, as well as the Children’s Court. NLD had never told her daughter about the sexual assault and complains now that the department’s use and disclosure of that information interfered with her privacy in contravention of the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 (Vic) (PDP Act).

[2]  NLD first complained to the Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner (OVIC)[1](https://plus.lexis.com/apac/document/?pdmfid=1539278&crid=b5c17807-94e3-45a7-8056-e773cca2ef72&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases-au%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A6873-XVH1-DYMS-62T0-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=267716&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&prid=96b9b2e0-6767-49b2-9ed6-c22c793cf046&ecomp=s85k&earg=sr40#) and that office, at NLD’s request, forwarded NLD’s complaint to VCAT, as permitted by section 71(4) of the PDP Act. Eventually the complaint came before me for hearing on 30 March 2023 and after hearing evidence and submissions I reserved my decision.

## Order
