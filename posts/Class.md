Class as a concept has two main uses:
1. Describing a structural factor in economic relationships between people
2. Describing a structural factor in social relationships between people
Q: what is the distinction between economic and social?

Class as an economic relationship structure is about your status in relationship to institutions, independent of your behaviour (?)
Like even if you lose or quit your job, you have capital, and this means that there is an extent to which your ability to live is protected by institutions like the State (police, border force, local council, tax office, welfare office...), banks, retailers...
In capitalism, living = access to capital. If you own a house you can live there. If you own a car you can drive it. If not, money is needed to pay rent, travel. You always need money for food. Capital = life is a core abstraction that makes the system work

Class as a social relationship structure is about what you can do - what job you can work, what spaces you can enter, what laws you can break, what people you can talk to, what goals you can have, what loans you can get, what grants you can get...
It includes economic relationships but it is bigger and more deeply fused to your identity and experience of life
