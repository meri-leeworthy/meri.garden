Organ subproposals:
- Confirm 'Organ' as the name of the app to be developed
- Radical Directory Incorporated to collect and manage funds on behalf of the Organ project until a more suitable body is created in the future
- To apply for a grant from Lush as seed funding to undertake research and community consultation in preparation for larger grants
- To accept Expressions of Interest from social justice oriented organisations in being part of an initial research and consultation process and/or becoming members of a federation in the future that steers the direction of the project (note that governance of a particular instance e.g. Radical Directory would be out of scope and should be handled by a seperate structure)


All we can do as designers of software is to say "users might want to do this", based on whatever intuition or hopefully reasoning or research we have available. 


Organ proposal:
Give brief context then link to more. 
Requirements can be in main doc?

This document is the outcome of a process of research and learning undertaken by the author in collaboration with a small group of grassroots activists called Radical Directory. You can learn more about who we are here.

The process has broadly been about how technology can be used to promote political organising for social justice, and narrowly about ways to achieve these two goals:

- Enabling easy event coordination and information sharing (publishing) while protecting privacy and autonomy of users
- Using community-led design and open networks to improve discovery, access and onboarding for new members to join groups

These goals are not specific to grassroots activism or political organising. In fact, the need for tools of coordination and discovery are currently both largely met by for-profit social networks such as Facebook (without the privacy, autonomy, etc.). Noting as well that information sharing and event organising have a natural overlap with access and onboarding processes, my research has focused on understanding the requirements and potential technical solutions for a new app that would better support communities (of any kind) to achieve these goals. The proposal below describes one such technical solution in the hope of receiving critical feedback and/or support from individuals and organisations to implement it. 


Requirements:
Autonomy:
A major criticism of dominant social media platforms is the centralisation of power to regulate how the platform is used. Who can access what data, who can have an account, what people can post: these are all regulated (or can be regulated) by the companies that operate these platforms. 




Proposed projects

Documentation Collective
- attending grassroots talks and community forums, creating audio and video documentation, and AI-enhanced transcription 
- Callout for volunteers interested in Machine Learning to help train and set up a Speech-To-Text (STT) model for the community





Research with organisers
- look back at a campaign or action - what information did you need, at what point? Where did that information come from?

Anarchism = the practice of distributed counter-governance

Narratives fuel action
Activism is narrative making



Automate organising
Governance is for everyone
