- Complaint of being terminated from employment based on having engaged in lawful sexual activity with a former student who was an adult at the time  the relationship started: [13]
- Martin sought compensation for past economic loss, future economic loss  and compensation for pain and suffering. The court had regard to the fact  that the applicant’s annual salary was $87,000.00: [97]
- Martin relied on a medical certificate to substantiate the claim for pain and  suffering. He gave evidence that he was under the care of a GP and  psychologist, rarely left the house and was unable to function normally:  [102]
- Court found that “in standing Mr Martin down and then dismissing him, Mr Houlihan directly discriminated against Mr Martin by treating him unfavourably because of his lawful sexual activity with Ms Anderson”: [94]. Further, “I accept that the reasons for dismissal were multi-faceted but the lawful sexual activity was a substantial reason for the decision and I so find.”: [95].
- Although the evidence was “thin”, it was found that “Mr Martin suffered great distress and humiliation and even though the available medical  evidence is slight, what there is speaks to a period of unwellness, of  clinical depression, of the need for counselling and an indication that this occurred”: [105]
