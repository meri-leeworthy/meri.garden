BACKGROUND

[1]  Anne Black, the Applicant, lives in an apartment in a large complex. Around two years ago, after purchasing the apartment, Ms Black developed disabilities which affect her mobility. Ms Black requires a wheelchair or mobility scooter and crutches to transfer from one chair to another. She is also legally blind, although she has some vision. Ms Black has difficulty accessing her apartment home because she is unable to operate heavy manual doors in the building, including entry doors from the street and car park, and because a ramp in the car park is unsafe for her.

[2]  On 18 December 2015, Ms Black first asked the owners corporations for urgent attention to the accessibility issues in the building.[1](https://plus.lexis.com/apac/document/?pdmfid=1539278&crid=b4bb0723-a3f3-4d98-a6be-0d2cfe162d42&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases-au%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A64VD-JMH1-JX8W-M1ST-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=267716&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&prid=ad87f097-9618-4b1b-9cc8-07b551fd89aa&ecomp=s85k&earg=sr7#)

[3]  On 14 September 2016, Ms Black applied to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) about the issue, seeking orders that the owners corporations responsible for the common property of the building where she lives make alterations, so that she could access the building and common areas independently.

[4]  The parties agreed on a set of questions of law for the Tribunal to determine. In response to one of those questions, I ruled earlier in this proceeding that the Respondent owners corporations are service providers who provide a service to Ms Black as defined in the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (EO Act). Consequently, they must comply with sections 44, 45 and 46 of that Act which require reasonable adjustments to be made to services, to accommodate users with a disability.

[5]  The question of what that compliance entails is now to be determined. On 7 November 2011 there was a hearing. Ms Black relied on her witness statement of 8 March 2017 and on a supplemental witness statement dated 1 November 2018. Attached to her first statement was the expert report of Murray Mountain of Access Design Solutions dated 6 December 2016 (the Access Design Solutions report). That report recommended modifications which would make the doors used by Ms Black in the common areas of the apartment building accessible for her. It wrongly assumed that the building was subject to a particular disability standard. The issue for determination now is whether those recommended modifications are reasonable in all the circumstances.

[6]  The Respondents had also provided an expert report from Roy Harding and Associates dated 31 July 2017, addressing only whether the Access Design Solutions report had applied the relevant disability access standards. For the current issues, Galina Roy provided a witness statement dated 14 September 2018 for the Respondents.

[7]  At the hearing, Ms Black was cross-examined by telephone and Ms Roy was cross-examined in person. I reserved my decision. After the hearing, I went to the building to observe the places where adjustments were said to be required. Ms Black demonstrated her difficulties in negotiating the doors and accessing the common property and we were accompanied by the Respondents’ solicitor and Ms Black’s solicitor.

...

[135]  It is difficult to quantify Ms Black’s loss in monetary terms. I note that she has suffered being unable to access the common areas of her building daily for three years. In particular she has needed to seek assistance to enter her front door. Taking into account the daily frustration and humiliation she has experienced and considering that she first brought the issues to the Respondents’ attention three years ago, I will order that they pay her $10,000.00 to compensate her for what she has suffered because of their contravention of the EO Act. I consider that to be a conservative amount in the circumstances.

[136]  For all these reasons, the above orders are made.

Orders accordingly.
