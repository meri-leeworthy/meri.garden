is the device doing what the person expects it to be doing?
leaking personal information
non-consensual transfers out of bank account
exfiltrating history of search queries, using that for advertising

we don't emphasise technical education

Xavier - cybersec 'an urgent national priority'
technical and cultural minimum standards

'increasing awareness'

my note: interesting conflation between personal security and institutional practices

Vanessa - noting the demonisation of end-to-end encryption
people are getting mixed messages about whether their messages should be secure
2fa is always sms

IoT devices standards - certification standards can be opaque and secret, meaning they can be ineffective

Vanessa:
secrecy and security
mistaken belief that things become secure because they are secret
code transparency in ACT digital voting system made flaws possible to detect

Ram:
top five methods of attack on companies:
unpatched exploits
phishing
stolen credentials
prior compromise
website compromise

Xavier:
cybersec strategy

cybersecurity bill
power for minister to introduce a standard
limited use obligation of cyber coordinator and [[Australian Signals Directorate (ASD)]]
information they share won't be used against them in regulatory context
to encourage and incentivise threat sharing
encouraging reporting across the economy
ransomware reporting


DNS filtering as a protective measure
'a blunt weapon' 'a disproportionate response'
removes agency from users
easily thwarted

data retention is a big problem - too much retention for too long, not clear direction for companies

DNS abuse contributing to cybersec problems
'the means rather than the medium'

phishing
farming
malware
botnets

Xavier 'cybersecurity is a culture problem'


New regulations and open source software
