**Applicant:** Ms. Ewin, an employee of Living and Leisure Australia Limited (LLA).

**Respondent:** Mr. Vergara, an accountant employed by a labor-hire firm to work for LLA.

- Applicant was subjected to severe sexual harassment by a colleague including unwelcome advances and explicit emails in her workplace.
- Specific incidents included Mr. Vergara turning off the lights in Ms. Ewin's office, making sexual propositions, and engaging in unwanted sexual intercourse after a work function. 
- Resulted in significant psychological injury requiring treatment.
- The claim included emotional distress and financial losses (Medical expenses).
- The respondent appealed the initial decision, arguing that neither the hotel premises nor the street should be considered as a ‘workplace’ under the SDA, as neither party was performing work-related functions there.
- However, the majority of the Full Court upheld the initial judge’s decision, stating that the visit to the hotel was indeed an extension of their workplace issues, viewing the actions of both parties objectively. It was found that while Mr. Vergara's motive might have been to solicit sexual favours, Ms. Ewin continued to address the harassment from the office by moving to a safer, more public location.

- Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth) s 46PO
- Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) s 140
- Sex and Age Discrimination Legislation Amendment Act 2011 (Cth) sch 1, items 54, 55, 69

**REASONS FOR JUDGMENT**

**WHITE J**

1.  1 A Judge found that in four separate incidents in May 2009 the
    appellant contravened s 28B(6) of the *Sex Discrimination Act 1984
    *(Cth) (the SD Act) by sexually harassing the respondent: *Ewin v
    Vergara (No 3) *\[2013\] FCA 1311. In the first three incidents, the
    harassment comprised, in the main, spoken words. In the fourth
    incident, it comprised sexual intercourse, kissing, and touching and
    stroking of the respondent's body, including her breasts and
    genitalia. The Judge made declarations which reflected these
    findings.

2.  2 The Judge assessed the compensation to which the respondent was
    entitled for the loss and damage caused by the conduct at \$476,163
    together with interest but, after making allowance for other
    recoveries by the respondent, entered judgment against the appellant
    for \$210,563 inclusive of interest.

3.  3 The appellant appeals against aspects of the findings of sexual
    harassment and against the assessment of damages.

4.  4 In May 2009, the respondent was 36 years old and recently married.
    She is a Chartered Accountant and was employed by Living and Leisure
    Australia Ltd (LLA) as its Group Financial Controller.

5.  5 The appellant was also working at LLA as an accountant. However,
    he was employed by Robert Walters Pty Ltd (RWA), a recruitment and
    labour hire firm. He worked at LLA pursuant to a contract between
    RWA and LLA. In May 2009, the appellant was 40 years old and married
    with three children.

6.  6 The office of LLA was at Level 13, 474 Flinders Street, Melbourne.
    Both the appellant and the respondent worked in that office.

7.  7 Section 28B of the SD Act proscribes sexual harassment in a
    variety of employment and work contexts. As the appellant and the
    respondent were employees of different entities, s 28B(6) and (7)
    were pertinent in this case. As in force in May 2009, s 28(6)
    and (7) provided:

\(6\) It is unlawful for a workplace participant to sexually harass
another workplace participant at a place that is a workplace of both of
those persons.

\(7\) In this section:

***place ***includes a ship, aircraft or vehicle.

***workplace*** means a place at which a workplace participant works or
otherwise carries out functions in connection with being a workplace
participant.

***workplace participant*** means any of the following:

\(a\) an employer or employee;

\(b\) a commission agent or contract worker;

\(c\) a partner in a partnership.

1.  8 It was common ground at trial and on the appeal that the appellant
    was a "contract worker" as defined in s 4(1) of the SD Act and
    therefore within par (b) of the definition of "workplace
    participant", and that the respondent was an "employee" to whom
    par (a) of that definition referred.

2.  9 Sexual harassment, for the purposes of s 28B, is defined in s 28A
    of the SD Act. Section 28A provides:

**28A Meaning of sexual harassment**

\(1\) For the purposes of this Division, a person sexually harasses
another person (the ***person harassed***) if:

\(a\) the person makes an unwelcome sexual advance, or an unwelcome
request for sexual favours, to the person harassed; or

\(b\) engages in other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in relation
to the person harassed;

in circumstances in which a reasonable person, having regard to all the
circumstances, would have anticipated that the person harassed would be
offended, humiliated or intimidated.

\(2\) In this section:

***conduct of a sexual nature*** includes making a statement of a sexual
nature to a person, or in the presence of a person, whether the
statement is made orally or in writing.

1.  **The contraventions of s 28B(6)**




1.  10 In broad terms, the conduct of the appellant which the Judge
    found to contravene s 28B(6) was as follows:

\(a\) On Wednesday, 13 May 2009, at the end of the working day, the
appellant turned off the lights in the office which he shared with the
respondent, walked behind her, and tried in the dark to touch her hand
so as to turn her computer off, stating that she should finish work. He
told the respondent that he would turn the light back on only if she
agreed to come to talk to him, as he wished to tell her something. The
respondent agreed and they went to the Waterside Hotel.

At the hotel, the appellant sexually propositioned the respondent in
very explicit and crude terms, and proposed that they have an affair.
The respondent refused. Outside the hotel and on the way to Southern
Cross Train Station, the appellant tried to kiss the respondent. The
Judge characterised the appellant's conduct in the LLA office in terms
of s 28A(1)(b) and the remaining conduct in terms of both s 28A(1)(a)
and (b).

\(b\) On Thursday, 14 May 2009, at the office of KPMG, the appellant
again sexually propositioned the respondent and made other statements of
a sexual kind. The Judge was satisfied that this conduct was within both
s 28A(1)(a) and (b).

\(c\) On Friday, 15 May 2009, at the office of LLA, the appellant asked
the respondent "what are you doing to keep Claudio happy?". Claudio is
the appellant's first name. In the light of the events over the
preceding days, the Judge regarded this question as a request for sexual
favours. The Judge held that s 28A(1)(b) applied to this conduct.

\(d\) In the late evening of 15 May 2009, at the LLA office, the
appellant engaged in sexual intercourse with the respondent and in
touching and stroking her naked body, including her breasts and
genitalia. The Judge characterised this conduct in terms of s 28A(1)(b).

1.  11 Unsurprisingly, the findings about these events were based to a
    significant extent on the Judge's assessment of the evidence of the
    appellant and the respondent. The Judge did not regard the appellant
    as a credible witness, finding that he was prepared to say anything
    which would assist his case. He said of the appellant's evidence (at
    \[57\]):

... I have approached all of Mr Vergara's evidence with suspicion. I
have rejected it unless a cogent foundation existed (whether by reason
of corroborating evidence or otherwise), which permitted me to regard Mr
Vergara's account as likely to be reliable.

The Judge gave detailed reasons for this assessment of the appellant's
credibility and for his rejection of much of his evidence.

1.  12 The Judge regarded the respondent's evidence as generally more
    reliable, although he considered that her evidence had been
    influenced by her animosity towards the appellant, a circumstance
    which had been aggravated by the fact that the appellant, being
    unrepresented, had cross-examined the respondent himself. In
    relation to the respondent's evidence, the Judge concluded (at
    \[68\]):

... On the essential features of her account of the principal events, Ms
Ewin's evidence was consistent and cogent. However, I have taken a
cautious approach to accepting Ms Ewin's evidence and particularly so in
relation to those topics mentioned above, where I considered her
reliability to be particularly vulnerable. I have only accepted Ms
Ewin's evidence where I regarded it to be cogent and not significantly
inconsistent with the prior statements she had made. Where her evidence
was corroborated by other evidence, I had no difficulty accepting it.

1.  13 In reaching these conclusions, the Judge considered in detail the
    consistency of the evidence of the appellant and the respondent with
    previous statements made by them, as well as with the evidence of
    witnesses called by each of the appellant and the respondent. The
    previous statements included statements which each had made to the
    police, statements which each had made in the course of two recorded
    conversations when the respondent, acting on a pretext, telephoned
    the appellant in July 2009, statements which the respondent had made
    in a conversation with a Nurse-On-Call service on 17 May 2014 (which
    had also been recorded), and statements which the respondent had
    made to a psychiatrist whom she consulted after the events in May
    2009 for treatment. As can be seen from the passage quoted above,
    the Judge's acceptance of the respondent's evidence turned very much
    on the extent to which it was consistent with her previous
    statements. On the other hand, the Judge noted several
    inconsistencies between the appellant's evidence at trial and his
    previous statements.

    1.  **Grounds 1-5: The finding of sexual intercourse and touching**




1.  14 In relation to the incidents on the evening of 15 May 2009, the
    Judge made the following findings:

\[445\] I find that on 15 May, at or about the corridor outside the
front door of the LLA office:

\(i\) Mr Vergara engaged in sexual intercourse with Ms Ewin; and

\(ii\) engaged in kissing Ms Ewin and touching and stroking her naked
body including her breasts and genitalia.

\[446\] I find that the conduct was conduct of a "sexual nature" within
the statutory meaning of that phrase as contained in s 28A(1)(b) of the
SD Act. As French J said in *Hall v Sheiban *at 283, unwelcome sexual
conduct will clearly extend to acts which may also constitute offences
and civil wrongs such as sexual assault.

1.  15 The Judge accepted that the respondent had no memory of this
    incident (at \[66\]), finding that she had been heavily intoxicated
    from about 10.00pm to at least midnight on 15 May (at \[453\]).

    a.  ***The issue on appeal concerning the finding of sexual
        intercourse and touching***




1.  16 By grounds 1 to 5 of his amended notice of appeal, the appellant
    contended, in various ways, that it had not been open to the Judge
    to be satisfied to the requisite degree that the sexual intercourse
    and sexual touching had occurred and, accordingly, that he had on 15
    May 2009 engaged in conduct contravening s 28B(6) of the SD Act.
    Ground 1 asserted that it had not been open to the Judge to make
    these findings given that:

\(a\) \[The Judge\] had accepted \[450\] the evidence that some 40
minutes or so "prior to the sexual activity", the respondent experienced
nausea, sweatiness, the room expanding and contracting, vomiting and
very substantial amnesia;

\(b\) his Honour had accepted that: "Fragmentary amnesia continued until
after midnight and at that time \[the respondent\] was still feeling
foggy, sick and dizzy." \[450\];

\(c\) the appellant's response (in the record of interview held on 18
November 2009) to the police, when the latter put to him "Is it possible
that you may have penetrated her?", he answered, inter alia, "I-it-you
m- , it may have been possible yeah -- Possibly" ...;

\(d\) the police did not lay a charge of rape or of any other sexual
offence against the appellant in respect of those events; and

\(e\) the respondent had raised the allegation and bore the onus of
proof to prove on the balance of probabilities that the appellant had
engaged in sexual intercourse with her on 15 May 2009.

1.  17 By Ground 3, the appellant asserted that the Judge had been in
    error in concluding at \[439\] that he had engaged in an "evasive
    attempt to avoid admitting to police that there had been sexual
    penetration". By Ground 4, the appellant asserted that it had not
    been open to the Judge to infer, as he did at \[442\], that "even if
    the activity did not include vaginal penetration, it involved Mr
    Vergara extensively touching and stroking Ms Ewin's breasts and
    genitalia". Grounds 2 and 5 alleged that, in the light of the
    matters alleged in Grounds 1, 3 and 4, it had not been open to the
    Judge to find that the respondent had proved her case.

2.  18 In introducing his submission on these grounds, counsel said that
    the appellant did "not shrink" from the Judge's findings that the
    appellant had, in the days prior to 15 May 2009, expressed his
    desire to have sexual intercourse with the respondent; that in or
    about the corridor outside the front door of the LLA office, the
    appellant had been substantially naked and some of the appellant's
    own clothing had been removed; that the appellant had been sexually
    aroused and had an erection; that the appellant and the respondent
    had been in the corridor for approximately 30 minutes to one hour;
    and that the respondent had reported waking on the morning of 16 May
    2009 with physical symptoms consistent with deep penetration of her
    vagina having occurred.

3.  19 Counsel also accepted that the appellant had made a number of
    admissions when interviewed by the police on 18 November 2009 of an
    incriminating kind. These included the appellant's admissions that
    he could not exclude the possibility that sexual intercourse had
    occurred; that there was a chance that semen said by the respondent
    to have been found on her boots could be his; and, although not
    admitting to ejaculation, his statement that:

It was probably me. I would be surprised if, you know, it was somebody
else. I'm saying it's probably me, somehow.

The appellant had also admitted to the police that he and the respondent
had engaged in "a lot of ... amorous type" activity, described as
"carrying on", "consensual sex" and "sexual activity", and that they had
been "two animals".

1.  20 Counsel submitted that, despite these matters, it had not been
    open to the Judge to reach the degree of satisfaction necessary for
    the findings made in \[445\] of the reasons, quoted earlier in these
    reasons.

2.  21 Counsel emphasised the gravity of the finding of sexual
    intercourse and sexual touching in the context that this conduct was
    also found to be "unwelcome". He contended that it was tantamount to
    a finding of rape. Counsel referred to the moral obloquy flowing
    from the finding, suggesting that it would stigmatise the appellant
    permanently. In these circumstances, counsel submitted that the
    Judge had failed to apply appropriately the approach discussed by
    Dixon J in *Briginshaw v Briginshaw* (1938) 60 CLR 336 and as
    required by s 140 of the *Evidence Act 1995 *(Cth) (Evidence Act),
    saying:

We contend ... that, in spite of what the learned trial judge said in
the Reasons at \[464\], he materially underestimated the impact of the
gravity of the matter alleged. That being so, his Honour did not,
properly understood, take into account the gravity of the matters
alleged, as was his duty under s 140(2)(c) of the *Evidence Act 1995*
(Cth).

1.  22 This contention was at the heart of the appellant's submissions
    with respect to the Judge's findings concerning the events of 15 May
    2009 and, accordingly, it is appropriate to refer in some detail to
    the relevant principles.

2.  23 In the well-known passage in *Briginshaw *at 361-2 (which
    involved the question of whether adultery had been proved), Dixon J
    held:

\[W\]hen the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel
an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be
found. It cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of
probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. No doubt an
opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite
gradations of certainty; and this has led to attempts to define exactly
the certainty required by the law for vicarious purposes. ... Except
upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that
the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable
satisfaction of the tribunal. *But reasonable satisfaction is not a
state of mind that is attained or established independently of the
nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. The
seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an
occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences
flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect
the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the
reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal.* In such matters "reasonable
satisfaction" should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite
testimony, or indirect inferences.

(Emphasis added)

As can be seen, Dixon J emphasised that the nature and consequence of
the fact to be proved is pertinent to the degree of satisfaction
required of the fact finder before concluding that the fact has been
proved. Dixon J continued at 362-3:

This does not mean that some standard of persuasion is fixed
intermediate between the satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt required
upon a criminal inquest and the reasonable satisfaction which in a civil
issue may, not must, be based on a preponderance of probability. It
means that the nature of the issue necessarily affects the process by
which reasonable satisfaction is attained. *When, in a civil proceeding,
a question arises whether a crime has been committed, the standard of
persuasion is, according to the better opinion, the same as upon other
civil issues ... But, consistently with this opinion, weight is given to
the presumption of innocence and exactness of proof is expected.*

(Emphasis added)

Similarly, at 347, Latham CJ said:

\[T\]he ordinary standard of proof in civil matters must be applied to
the proof of adultery in divorce proceedings, subject only to the rule
of prudence that any tribunal should act with much care and caution
before finding that a serious allegation such as that of adultery is
established.

The reasons of Rich J at 350 contain a statement to like effect:

In a serious matter like a charge of adultery the satisfaction of a just
and prudent mind cannot be produced by slender and exiguous proofs or
circumstances pointing with a wavering finger to an affirmative
conclusion. The nature of the allegation requires as a matter of common
sense and worldly wisdom the careful weighing of testimony, the close
examination of facts proved as a basis of inference and a comfortable
satisfaction that the tribunal has reached both a correct and just
conclusion.

1.  24 Reference may also be made to *Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan
    Holdings Pty Ltd *(1992) 67 ALJR 170 at 171 in which Mason CJ,
    Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ said:

\[T\]he strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact or facts
on the balance of probabilities may vary according to the nature of what
it is sought to prove. Thus, authoritative statements have often been
made to the effect that clear or cogent or strict proof is necessary
"where so serious a matter as fraud is to be found". Statements to that
effect should not, however, be understood as directed to the standard of
proof. Rather, they should be understood as merely reflecting a
conventional perception that members of our society do not ordinarily
engage in fraudulent or criminal conduct and a judicial approach that a
court should not lightly make a finding that, on the balance of
probabilities, a party to civil litigation has been guilty of such
conduct.

Counsel referred also to *Morley v Australian Securities and Investments
Commission *\[2010\] NSWCA 331 at \[735\]-\[753\] and to *Seltsam Pty
Ltd v McGuiness *\[2000\] NSWCA 29 at \[136\].

1.  25 The effect of the approach stated in *Briginshaw* and the later
    authorities is that the graver the allegations and their potential
    consequences, the stronger is the evidence required to conclude that
    the allegations have been established: *Ashby v Slipper *\[2014\]
    FCAFC 15 at \[69\].

2.  26 Section 140 of the Evidence Act* *provides:

[140]{#_Toc329076188}** Civil proceedings: standard of proof**

\(1\) In a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party
proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance
of probabilities.

\(2\) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account
in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account:

\(a\) the nature of the cause of action or defence; and

\(b\) the nature of the subject‑matter of the proceeding; and

\(c\) the gravity of the matters alleged.

It has been held that s 140(2) reflects the common law as stated in
*Briginshaw* and as applied in the later authorities: *Morley v ASIC*
\[2010\] NSWCA 331 at \[737\]; *Communications, Electrical, Electronic,
Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of
Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission *\[2007\]
FCAFC 132 at \[30\]; (2007) 162 FCR 466 at 480; *Ashby v Slipper
*\[2014\] FCAFC 15 at \[71\].

1.  27 The Judge in the present case did not overlook these authorities,
    nor the content of s 140. He referred (at \[90\]-\[93\] and \[464\])
    to s 140(2) of the Evidence Act and (at \[95\]) to the passage in
    the reasons in *Neat Holdings *quoted above.

2.  28 The Judge concluded his findings with respect to the events of 15
    May 2009 by saying (at \[464\]):

My satisfaction that Ms Ewin proved her case on the balance of
probabilities included consideration of the matters specified by s
140(2) of the Evidence Act. I regarded the gravity of the conduct
alleged as very serious. A high degree of moral opprobrium attaches to
conduct of the kind alleged, although not nearly so much as would have
attached to a rape or a serious sexual assault which involves an intent
to rape or assault as a necessary element of the offence. Having regard
to the seriousness of the conduct involved, I was satisfied that the
strength of the evidence was sufficient to establish, on the balance of
probabilities, that Ms Ewin had proved her case.

This is a clear indication that the Judge was conscious of the gravity
of the appellant's allegations and of the need for cogent evidence
before he found those allegations proved.

1.  29 Counsel for the appellant contended that, whilst the Judge had
    referred to s 140(2) and to *Neat Holdings* and therefore to the
    requirement for cogent proof of the respondent's serious
    allegations, he had not in fact applied such an approach. Counsel
    relied on the following matters:

\(a\) The respondent, who was on the Judge's finding (at \[453\])
heavily intoxicated at the time of the incident she alleged, had no
recollection of it and could give no direct evidence about it. The
appellant submitted that the Judge, while finding that the respondent
had no recollection of the incident, failed to address the significance
of that finding. The Judge should, it was said, have regarded the
respondent's absence of recollection as "a fatal weakness" to her claim
which, in the absence of an "unequivocal admission" by the appellant
that sexual intercourse had occurred, "compelled" the conclusion that
the allegation be dismissed;

\(b\) The appellant had made no clear admission that he had engaged in
sexual intercourse with the respondent;

\(c\) The rejection of the appellant's evidence could not be regarded as
positive proof that intercourse had occurred. Disbelief in a witness'
evidence does not ordinarily establish the contrary: *Kuligowski v
Metrobus *\[2004\] HCA 34 at \[60\]; (2004) 220 CLR 363 at 385. The
Judge had in any event been in error in characterising the appellant's
responses when interviewed by the police as "an evasive attempt to avoid
admitting to police that there had been sexual penetration";

\(d\) Although the matter had been reported to the police, they had not
laid any charge of rape or other sexual offence against the appellant;

\(e\) The evidence to support a finding of sexual intercourse or sexual
touching of Ms Ewin's breasts and genitalia was "weak".

a.  ***Appellate review: The principles***




1.  30 The respondent's claim with respect to the events on the evening
    of 15 May was a circumstantial case. This meant that the evidence
    accepted by the Judge had to support a "reasonable and definite
    inference" that sexual intercourse and touching of the respondent's
    breasts and genitalia had occurred and not merely "conflicting
    inferences of equal degree of probability so that the choice between
    them \[was a\] mere matter of conjecture": *Bradshaw v McEwans Pty
    Ltd *(1951) 217 ALR 1 at 5; *Jones v Dunkel *(1959) 101 CLR 298 at
    304-5; *Trustees of the Property of Cummins (a bankrupt) v Cummins
    *\[2006\] HCA 6 at \[34\]; (2006) 227 CLR 278 at 292;
    *Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information,
    Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian
    Competition and Consumer Commission *\[2007\] FCAFC 132 at
    \[38\]; (2007) 162 FCR 466 at 482.

2.  31 The approach required of an appellate court in determining
    challenges to findings of fact made by a trial judge was the subject
    of some debate at the hearing. In my view, the proper approach is
    well-established. In *Fox v Percy* \[2003\] HCA 22 at
    \[25\]-\[29\]; (2003) 214 CLR 118 at 126-8, Gleeson CJ, Gummow and
    Kirby JJ said:

\[25\] Within the constraints marked out by the nature of the appellate
process, the appellate court is obliged to conduct a real review of the
trial and, in cases where the trial was conducted before a judge sitting
alone, of that judge's reasons. Appellate courts are not excused from
the task of "weighing conflicting evidence and drawing \[their\] own
inferences and conclusions, though \[they\] should always bear in mind
that \[they have\] neither seen nor heard the witnesses, and should make
due allowance in this respect". In *Warren v Coombes*, the majority of
this Court reiterated the rule that:

"\[I\]n general an appellate court is in as good a position as the trial
judge to decide on the proper inference to be drawn from facts which are
undisputed or which, having been disputed, are established by the
findings of the trial judge. In deciding what is the proper inference to
be drawn, the appellate court will give respect and weight to the
conclusion of the trial judge but, once having reached its own
conclusion, will not shrink from giving effect to it."

As this Court there said, that approach was "not only sound in law, but
beneficial in ... operation".

\[26\] After *Warren v Coombes*, a series of cases was decided in which
this Court reiterated its earlier statements concerning the need for
appellate respect for the advantages of trial judges, and especially
where their decisions might be affected by their impression about the
credibility of witnesses whom the trial judge sees but the appellate
court does not. Three important decisions in this regard were *Jones v
Hyde*, *Abalos v Australian Postal Commission* and *Devries v Australian
National Railways Commission*. This trilogy of cases did not constitute
a departure from established doctrine. The decisions were simply a
reminder of the limits under which appellate judges typically operate
when compared with trial judges.

\[27\] The continuing application of the corrective expressed in the
trilogy of cases was not questioned in this appeal. The cases mentioned
remain the instruction of this Court to appellate decision-making
throughout Australia. However, that instruction did not, and could not,
derogate from the obligation of courts of appeal, in accordance with
legislation such as the *Supreme Court Act* applicable in this case, to
perform the appellate function as established by Parliament. Such courts
must conduct the appeal by way of rehearing. If, making proper allowance
for the advantages of the trial judge, they conclude that an error has
been shown, they are authorised, and obliged, to discharge their
appellate duties in accordance with the statute.

\[28\] Over more than a century, this Court, and courts like it, have
given instruction on how to resolve the dichotomy between the foregoing
appellate obligations and appellate restraint. From time to time, by
reference to considerations particular to each case, different emphasis
appears in such reasons. However, the mere fact that a trial judge
necessarily reached a conclusion favouring the witnesses of one party
over those of another does not, and cannot, prevent the performance by a
court of appeal of the functions imposed on it by statute. In particular
cases incontrovertible facts or uncontested testimony will demonstrate
that the trial judge\'s conclusions are erroneous, even when they appear
to be, or are stated to be, based on credibility findings.

\[29\] That this is so is demonstrated in several recent decisions of
this Court. In some, quite rare, cases, although the facts fall short of
being "incontrovertible", an appellate conclusion may be reached that
the decision at trial is "glaringly improbable" or "contrary to
compelling inferences" in the case. In such circumstances, the appellate
court is not relieved of its statutory functions by the fact that the
trial judge has, expressly or implicitly, reached a conclusion
influenced by an opinion concerning the credibility of witnesses. In
such a case, making all due allowances for the advantages available to
the trial judge, the appellate court must "not shrink from giving effect
to" its own conclusion. Finality in litigation is highly desirable.
Litigation beyond a trial is costly and usually upsetting. But in every
appeal by way of rehearing, a judgment of the appellate court is
required both on the facts and the law. It is not forbidden (nor in the
face of the statutory requirement could it be) by ritual incantation
about witness credibility, nor by judicial reference to the desirability
of finality in litigation or reminders of the general advantages of the
trial over the appellate process.

(Citations omitted)

1.  32 This means that an appeal requires a real review of the evidence.
    When a trial judge's decision on an issue involves an assessment of
    the quality and reliability of a witness, the appellate court must
    make due allowance for the advantage of the trial judge resulting
    from having seen and heard the witness give evidence. Despite that
    advantage, the court may overturn a finding based on credit if
    "incontrovertible facts" or "uncontested testimony" indicate error
    in the judge's conclusion or if the decision at trial is "glaringly
    improbable" or "contrary to compelling inferences".

2.  33 The appellate task in this case is made easier by the fact that
    the appellant does not, with the possible exception of Ground 3,
    challenge the primary findings of fact made by the Judge, nor the
    Judge's credit findings. His challenge instead was that it had not
    been appropriate for the Judge to infer from the found facts that
    sexual intercourse or sexual touching had occurred on the evening of
    15 May 2009. This is a case in which the Court was, in effect, asked
    to apply the approach outlined in *Warren v Coombes* (1979) 142 CLR
    531, that is, to decide on the proper inferences to be drawn from
    the facts found by the Judge and to give effect to its own
    conclusion in that respect. This has made it unnecessary for this
    Court to consider all of the evidence reviewed by the Judge in
    reaching those findings of fact which are undisputed in this Court.

    a.  ***Events before 15 May 2009***




1.  34 The appellant's evidence was to the effect that, before the week
    commencing 11 May 2009, he had been subject to "sexually predatory
    behaviour" by the respondent, which behaviour had commenced in early
    April 2009. He claimed that the respondent's behaviour towards him
    had been "intrusive, flirtatious and coercive" (at \[115\]); that
    she had regularly made bodily contact with him; that her behaviour
    had increased in intensity and in nature; that she had regularly
    massaged his neck and shoulders; that he had asked the respondent to
    desist but that she had persisted; that she had made a number of
    sexually suggestive remarks; and that he had had to take a number of
    steps to avoid or discourage her conduct. The Judge rejected this
    evidence in its entirety (at \[133\]), finding that it was
    untruthful and a recent invention (at \[134\]). The Judge also
    accepted the respondent's evidence of four incidents in the period
    between early April and 11 May 2009 and held that they evidenced the
    appellant's sexual interest in her (at \[145\]).

2.  35 In relation to events in the week commencing 11 May 2009, the
    appellant said that at the Southern Cross Train Station on the
    evening of 12 May 2009, the respondent had suggested that they go to
    a hotel for drinks and later had suggested that they go dancing
    together. He had declined that suggestion. The Judge accepted that
    the appellant and the respondent had had drinks together on the
    evening of 12 May, but found that that was at the appellant's
    instigation; that he had been the one who suggested that they go
    dancing (at \[164\]-\[165\]); and that they had not done so because
    the respondent had refused to do so.

3.  36 The appellant said that it had been the respondent who, on 13 May
    2009, had suggested that they go for a drink after work. He said
    that they had spoken mainly about matters concerning their work and
    had then walked to the Southern Cross Train Station together to
    catch trains to their respective homes. He denied having sexually
    propositioned the respondent. The Judge concluded that the
    appellant's account of the events on 13 May was "entirely
    unconvincing" (at \[208\]). In particular, the Judge noted that in
    one of the pretext telephone conversations, the appellant had
    effectively admitted sexually propositioning the respondent in the
    explicit and crude way she had described, and he found that had
    occurred on the evening of 13 May (at \[209\]).

4.  37 On Thursday, 14 May, the appellant and the respondent attended a
    meeting at KPMG regarding the affairs of LLA. The respondent's
    account was that, while they were waiting, the appellant sought the
    respondent's attitude to his sexual propositioning on the previous
    evening. She had responded by expressing disinterest and telling him
    that they would not be having an affair. The respondent's evidence
    was that the appellant had then responded with some very sexually
    explicit statements.

5.  38 The appellant denied this account. He said that he had
    accompanied the respondent to the meeting at KPMG unwillingly and
    that, while they were there, the respondent had proposed that on the
    Friday night they go to a Latin bar to dance. He had indicated that
    he was unable to do so. The Judge rejected the appellant's account
    and, in substance, accepted that of the respondent.

    a.  ***The events of 15 May 2009***




1.  39 On Friday, 15 May 2009, in the late afternoon, the appellant, the
    respondent, other employees of LLA and employees of the Melbourne
    Aquarium attended a drinks function at the Aquarium. Both the
    appellant and the respondent consumed some alcohol while there but
    had relatively little to do with one another. At about 7.00pm, a
    group, which included the appellant and the respondent, moved to the
    Insignia Bar in Flinders Street, Melbourne. Both consumed some
    alcohol at that Bar. At about 10.00pm, the respondent began to feel
    sick, hot, nauseous and giddy. She went to the toilet where she
    vomited. The respondent deposed then to having no recollection for a
    period of about two hours, with her next recollection being back in
    Flinders Street at the front door of the Insignia Bar at about 12.00
    midnight.

2.  40 The respondent said that during the course of the evening she had
    attempted to avoid contact with the appellant, although they had
    spoken from time to time.

3.  41 In general, the evidence of the respondent was supported by that
    of another witness, Ms Thomas, whom the Judge regarded as honest and
    reliable. At one stage during the evening, and as a result of a
    comment made to her by the respondent about the appellant, Ms Thomas
    went looking for the respondent. She saw the appellant and the
    respondent standing together with the appellant's arm across the
    respondent's body holding her against a wall. The respondent
    appeared to be angry and yelling at the appellant. Ms Thomas
    enquired "is everything OK?" to which the respondent answered with
    words like "I am handling it".

4.  42 Ms Thomas saw the respondent later in the ladies' toilet. The
    respondent appeared to be drunk and angry, and was swearing about
    the appellant. The Judge accepted Ms Thomas' evidence and found that
    the appellant and the respondent had had an angry confrontation, in
    the course of which she had expressed vehement resistance to the
    appellant's sexual propositioning (at \[429\]-\[430\]).

5.  43 As already indicated, the respondent said that her next
    recollection was being back at the front door of the Insignia Bar.
    She attracted the attention of two staff members and obtained from
    them some possessions which she had left in the bar, including her
    laptop, wallet and handbag. The respondent went to the Southern
    Cross Station intending to catch her train home but ultimately
    caught a taxi instead.

6.  44 The appellant's account was to the following effect. At the
    Melbourne Aquarium, he and the respondent had had relatively little
    to do with one another. However, on one occasion, as the respondent
    had passed him, she had pulled him closer to her, kissed his
    earlobe, and at the same time "smiled sweetly". Later, and shortly
    before the function at the Aquarium concluded, the respondent had
    proposed that they have only a few drinks with the group at the
    Insignia Bar and then go alone to Latin bars for dancing. He had
    declined the suggestion.

7.  45 The appellant said that at the Insignia Bar he had been drinking
    with a small group which included the respondent until about
    10.30pm. When he went to leave, the respondent had said "wait for
    me, we are going dancing". He had responded by saying it was time to
    go home, but the respondent had pulled him by his backpack and that
    the next thing was "we were kissing somewhat passionately near the
    King Street exit door". He said that that continued for some minutes
    before the respondent expressed concern that they would be seen by
    work colleagues. She suggested that they go to the LLA office for
    privacy.

8.  46 The appellant's account of what occurred at the LLA office, as
    contained in his written witness statement, was as follows:

As we exited the lift the Applicant and I continued kissing in a very
passionate manner. We moved virtually attached around the corridor
nearest to the office door entrance. I recall the Applicant then began
to strip and unbuckled my belt and trousers whilst still kissing. That
continued for the next few minutes until the Applicant was completely
naked. I don't recall how she did it but she had nothing on other than
her knee high boots and a necklace. She was kissing and touching me all
over. Further, the Applicant was walking up and down the corridor in a
dancing like manner, simulating erotic dancing. That went on for a few
minutes. I then remember needing to go to the toilet urgently to urinate
as I had waited a little too long (before going to the toilet) while
watching the private show the Applicant (my boss) was providing for me.
I stood at the urinals and after a few minutes went back to the
corridor.

1.  47 The appellant said that when he came back from the toilet, the
    respondent was getting dressed and said that she needed to go to the
    Insignia Bar urgently to retrieve her laptop. They then "virtually
    raced" back to the Insignia Bar where the respondent did retrieve
    her laptop and from there they went to the Southern Cross Station.

    a.  ***The circumstantial case that sexual intercourse and sexual
        touching had occurred***

2.  48 On the evidence accepted by the Judge, the circumstantial case
    that sexual intercourse and sexual touching had occurred was strong.

2.  49 The principal uncontested findings from which the inference of
    sexual intercourse and touching of Ms Ewin's breasts and genitalia
    on 15 May 2009 could be drawn were the following:

\(a\) At approximately 10.40pm, the appellant and the respondent were
together and alone in the corridor outside the LLA office for between 30
minutes and one hour: at \[364\], \[437\]. The appellant had
acknowledged being there for some 20 minutes.

\(b\) The respondent was substantially naked and some of the appellant's
clothing had been removed: at \[348\], \[360\] and \[436\]. On his own
admission, the appellant's belt and trousers were unbuckled: at \[360\].

\(c\) The appellant was sexually aroused and had an erection: at
\[356\], \[436\].

\(d\) On his own admission, the appellant had kissed, cuddled and
caressed the respondent's naked body: at \[348\], \[350\] and \[438\],
although he did not admit that that included touching of the
respondent's breasts and genitalia.

\(e\) The respondent gave evidence that, on the morning of 16 May, she
had physical feelings consistent with deep vaginal penetration, a
burning feeling in her vagina and pain in her inner thighs: at \[381\],
\[384\]. Because of some inconsistencies between the respondent's
account of these matters in evidence and her account of the same matters
to the police, the Judge said (at \[440\]) that he would not have found
on the basis of the respondent's evidence on this topic alone that
intercourse had occurred. However, it is evident that he accepted it as
part of the circumstantial case, and it was appropriate for him to have
done so.

\(f\) In his interview by the police, the appellant had described his
and the respondent's activities on the night of 15 May as "sexual
activity" and "consensual sex"; that "there was a bit of carrying on, in
terms of sexual activity"; that there had been "kissing, cuddling,
caressing"; that they had been "two consenting adults"; and that they
had been "two animals": at \[350\] and \[357\]. It is evident that, at
the time of the police interview, the appellant had perceived the issue
as being that of whether his activity with the respondent had been
consensual.

\(g\) In the days preceding 15 May 2009, the appellant had communicated
in a "persistent" and "resolute" manner, his "vigorous" and "aggressive"
desire to have sexual intercourse with the respondent: at \[438\]. On 13
May, he had propositioned the respondent to have sexual intercourse with
him in crude and explicit language: at \[218\], \[222\], and on 14 May
he had made clear his sexual interest in the respondent: at \[250\] and
\[252\].

\(h\) On earlier occasions, the appellant had made remarks which, either
expressly or indirectly, indicated his sexual interest in the
respondent.

\(i\) The respondent's subsequent conduct was consistent with her belief
that sexual intercourse had occurred. The respondent contacted a
Nurse-On-Call service on 17 May and stated that she wanted to address
the risk of unwanted pregnancy from a "Friday night work's thing": at
\[393\]. The respondent made other statements during this call (which
was recorded) which were consistent with her belief that sexual
intercourse had occurred. In addition, the respondent told her treating
chiropractor, whom she consulted on 16 May, that she had pain and
stiffness to her right neck and shoulder as a result of a sexual assault
(at \[388\] and \[575\]).

\(j\) In a conversation with the respondent on 1 July 2009, the
appellant did not deny that sexual penetration had occurred,
acknowledged the possibility that it had in fact occurred, and instead
expressed doubt as to whether he had ejaculated: at \[353\] and \[439\].
This conversation occurred when the respondent, acting on a pretext,
informed the appellant that she was pregnant. The appellant's response,
which was recorded, indicates that he was alert to the possible
paternity implications.

As I have indicated, these were the principal uncontested findings
considered on the appeal. The Judge also made other findings which I
have not summarised as part of the circumstantial case.

a.  ***Ground 3 and the characterisation of an **"**evasive
    attempt**"***

1.  50 As noted earlier, by Ground 3 the appellant challenged the
    Judge's characterisation at \[439\] that the appellant's statements
    when interviewed by the police on 18 November 2009 were an "evasive
    attempt" to avoid admitting that there had been sexual penetration.
    The appellant submitted that this characterisation was an error,
    although the submissions did not indicate why it should be so
    regarded. It is appropriate to consider this ground before
    considering the effect of the uncontested findings summarised above.

2.  51 The context in which the Judge made the "evasive attempt"
    characterisation can be seen when \[439\] is quoted in full:

That finding \[of sexual intercourse\] is supported by the fact that
when Mr Vergara described to police the nature of the activities in
which he and Ms Ewin had been engaged, he said they were "two animals".
In my view that comment was a slip made by Mr Vergara in what was
otherwise an evasive attempt to avoid admitting to police that there had
been sexual penetration. The comment reveals that the nature of the
activities engaged in were vigorous and unrestricted. Mr Vergara's
vehement refusal to concede in cross-examination the act of penetration
was equally unconvincing especially in the light of the first pretext
conversation where Mr Vergara did not deny penetration, accepted it as a
possibility and instead sought to cast doubt on whether he had
ejaculated during intercourse.

1.  52 As can be seen, the focus of the Judge in \[439\] was on the
    significance of the appellant's description of the respondent and
    himself at the relevant time as "two animals". The Judge concluded
    that that comment indicated that their activities were vigorous and
    unrestricted. The appellant's admission in that respect enabled him
    more confidently to draw the conclusion that sexual intercourse had
    occurred. Curiously, the appellant did not challenge this aspect of
    the reasons in \[439\]. He challenged only the Judge's "evasive
    attempt" characterisation which, in context, appeared to be more in
    the nature of an aside.

2.  53 In the light of the appellant's challenge, I have reviewed the
    entire transcript of the interview of Sergeant Bannon of the
    appellant on 18 November 2009. It was not suggested that for the
    purpose of determining this ground of appeal the Court should also
    view the electronic record of that interview: cf. *Butera v Director
    of Public Prosecutions (Vic) *(1987) 164 CLR 180. The transcript of
    the interview is extensive, extending over 100 pages.

3.  54 Sergeant Bannon commenced by telling the appellant that she was
    interviewing him in relation to an allegation of rape of the
    respondent said to have occurred on 15 May 2009. The appellant
    acknowledged that he and the respondent had left the Insignia Bar
    together and had gone to the LLA office. Over the course of the
    interview, the appellant acknowledged that "there was a bit of
    carrying on, in terms of amorous activity ... We were ... two
    adults ... there probably was sexual activity, and that that's as
    far as I can remember ... there's nothing more to say ... there was
    two consenting adults ... she took ... all her clothes off and
    distinctively \[sic\] all she had on was her boots, and that's all
    she ... wanted to have on, and -- yeah, I probably had taken some
    clothes off as well ... There was some carrying on, sexual activity,
    but that's all I can remember ... Kissing, cuddling, caressing ...
    what else do people do? Two consenting adults? ... I'd say there
    were two adults consenting to sexual activity ... I'm not denying
    that \[the respondent\] and I were messing around in a sexual way in
    the office on the ... night of the 15^th^ of May. At times I did
    \[have an erection\] ... It was throughout ... \[the\] time that we
    were there ... was I there that night? Yeah, I was there that night.
    Was there sexual activity? Yes, sexual activity. ... She was naked,
    except for the boots and ... the rest is two adults consenting to
    sexual activity. What exactly we got up to I can't tell you the
    detail, because I can't exactly remember ... I'm not denying that I
    was there, and that there was sexual activity".

4.  55 Sergeant Bannon asked the appellant several questions on the
    topic of penetration:

Q203 Did you penetrate her with your penis in ...?

A That -- that part, I've been thinking about it since you rang me this
morning, and I -- I can't say that I did.

Q204 Yeah?

A Yeah I can't say that I did, and the reason for that is because ...

Q205 Yeah?

A And I was probably -- probably struggling to -- to -- to -- ... to
have a -- what do you call it -- sure I've got the right word --
erection.

...

Q207 Ok. Is it possible that you penetrated her with your penis?

A Possible? I don't know. I can't remember that part.

...

Q209 How -- how can you recall that you were struggling to get an
erection ...?

...

A No, no. I didn't say I was struggling to get an erection. I ...

Q211 Yeah?

A I -- that -- that happens when -- when -- so if you're asking "Did you
-- did you get that -- did you get to that point?"

Q212 Yeah?

A I -- I -- I'm a -- I'm a healthy male, but you get an erection at the
various point --, at different points and times for whatever reason, or
for obvious reasons, but you -- at that point in time when -- if you are
asking me did I -- did I penetrate \[the respondent\], I -- my answer is
I don't know.

Q213 Yeah?

A I don't think so.

...

Q220 Is it possible that you may have penetrated her?

A Is it possible? I -- it -- you m--, it may have been possible, yeah.

...

Q223 And then ...?

A But -- but I -- I guess my point is, it's two consenting adults. We're
in the room. She was making a point of just having her boots on only,
walking ...

Q224 Yeah.

A Up and down I -- I mean, you know ...

Q225 Yeah.

A Yeah. Two consenting adults here.

1.  56 The appellant told Sergeant Bannon that both he and the
    respondent were drunk. The following exchange then occurred:

Q246 ... do you believe that \[the respondent\] was actually able to
consent?

A I think you're just speculating with that comment. I -- I've got no
idea what -- and we were two animals. I said we were just ...

Q247 Yeah.

A Both having a drink. She was -- if I was saying to you she was running
up a -- running around, up and down, with her boots on making a point
...

Q248 Yeah.

A Of it.

Q249 Alright.

A And you tell me if she was able to consent.

1.  57 As can be seen, the appellant referred several times in these
    passages to the consensual nature of his activities with the
    respondent. This is understandable given that the police had flagged
    to him that they were concerned about the respondent's consent.

2.  58 Although the appellant emphasised the respondent's consent, he
    avoided an express acknowledgement that he had sexually penetrated
    the respondent. Given his recall of other events while he and the
    respondent were at the LLA office that night, his professed lack of
    recollection of whether penetration had occurred was implausible. On
    his own account he had been with the respondent for a significant
    period, she was naked and engaging in flaunting behaviour, he was
    sexually aroused, and he had kissed, cuddled and caressed the
    respondent.

3.  59 There was a reason for the appellant to be wary about making a
    formal admission of penetration as he had been told that the police
    were investigating an allegation of rape.

4.  60 Having reviewed the transcript of the police interview, I
    consider that the Judge's characterisation of the appellant's
    responses as an "evasive attempt" to avoid an admission that there
    had been sexual penetration was not only justified, but appropriate.
    It is not plausible to suppose, in the circumstances described by
    the appellant, that penile-vaginal intercourse did not occur or that
    the appellant was unaware that it had occurred.

5.  61 This ground of appeal fails.

    a.  ***Conclusion on the circumstantial case***

6.  62 In my opinion, the principal uncontested findings which I
    summarised earlier, together with the appellant's admissions to the
    police which I have outlined in the previous section of these
    reasons, constituted a compelling case that the appellant had sexual
    intercourse with the respondent on the night of 15 May 2009 and had
    engaged in the touching of her breasts and genitalia. The appellant
    was sexually interested in the respondent and had made his desires
    known to her. On the night of 15 May 2009, he had both the
    opportunity and the time to achieve his desire. On the unchallenged
    findings of fact, the Judge's conclusion that sexual intercourse had
    occurred was inevitable.

2.  63 It is improbable that sexual intercourse occurred, but not the
    touching of the respondent's breasts and genitalia. Counsel
    submitted that the appellant's admission that he had kissed, cuddled
    and caressed the respondent was not necessarily an admission that he
    had touched her breasts and genitalia. One may accept that that is
    so as a matter of theory but, in the circumstances of this case, it
    is not a realistic possibility. I also note that the appellant did
    not assert in his evidence that he had used the words "kissing,
    cuddling and caressing" when speaking to the police with some
    confined meaning, so as not to include the touching alleged.

3.  64 The particular circumstances to which the appellant drew
    attention on the appeal do not, in my opinion, displace the
    compelling effect of the evidence summarised above. The circumstance
    that the respondent was intoxicated and disoriented and had no
    memory of events meant only that she could not give direct evidence
    of the intercourse and sexual touching. It does not detract from the
    quality of the circumstantial case, which includes the significant
    admissions made by the appellant himself. I observe that it is not
    uncommon for juries to find proved to the criminal standard a charge
    of rape or unlawful sexual intercourse with an unconscious victim on
    evidence which is entirely circumstantial, and for such convictions
    to be upheld on appeal: see, for example, *R v McGuire *\[2013\] QCA
    290 and *R v Prasad *\[2009\] SASC 131. Contrary to the appellant's
    submission, the circumstance that the respondent had no recollection
    of the events did not "compel" a conclusion that her claim must
    fail.

4.  65 The circumstance that the police had not laid a charge of rape or
    of any other sexual offence is immaterial. It was for the Judge to
    assess the evidence, without regard to the assessments of others
    about that evidence. Further, the elements of the offence of rape
    are different from those of sexual harassment under the SD Act; the
    reasons for the police prosecution decision are not known; and the
    police may not, in any event, have had access to all the evidence
    adduced before the Judge.

5.  66 As already noted, the Judge was alert to the seriousness of the
    finding which he made in favour of the respondent. His reasons
    indicate that he reached his decision having regard to the necessity
    for cogent evidence. It is evident that the Judge scrutinised the
    respondent's evidence with care before accepting it and, even when
    accepting it, exercised care before relying on it as part of the
    circumstantial case against the appellant. There were some aspects
    of the respondent's evidence which the Judge did not accept. As
    noted earlier, the Judge said that he accepted the respondent's own
    evidence only when he regarded it to be cogent and not significantly
    inconsistent with her previous statements. The care which the Judge
    exercised in this respect is evident in his observations about the
    respondent's evidence at \[59\]-\[68\], \[145\], \[161\], \[454\],
    \[510\], \[518\]-\[519\], \[565\]-\[566\], \[584\]-\[585\] and
    \[590\].

6.  67 The finding of sexual intercourse and sexual touching was, in my
    opinion, not only open to the Judge on the evidence but a compelling
    finding. There is no basis on which this Court could conclude that
    the Judge did not apply appropriately the *Briginshaw* approach or
    had failed to give effect to s 140 of the Evidence Act.

7.  68 On the hearing of the appeal, the appellant complained only of
    the finding that sexual intercourse and sexual touching had
    occurred. He did not contest the finding that the sexual intercourse
    and sexual touching were "unwelcome" for the purposes of s 28A(1) of
    the SD Act.

8.  69 For these reasons, I consider that Grounds 1 to 5 fail.

    1.  **Ground 6: Did the harassment on 13 May 2009 occur at a
        "workplace"?**




1.  70 The Judge found that the conduct of the appellant in three
    separate incidents on the evening of 13 May 2009 amounted to sexual
    harassment in contravention of s 28B(6) of the SD Act. First, at
    about 8.30pm at the LLA office, the appellant turned off the office
    lights, walked behind the respondent's desk and touched her hand
    while attempting to turn off her computer. When the respondent
    protested, the appellant said that he would turn the lights on only
    if she agreed to come and talk to him about something. The
    respondent agreed to accompany the appellant to the Waterside Hotel
    which was across the road from the LLA office.

2.  71 At the Waterside Hotel, the appellant made a number of sexually
    explicit statements including proposing that he and the respondent
    have an affair.

3.  72 The third incident occurred when the appellant attempted to kiss
    the respondent while they were walking along King Street to their
    train station.

4.  73 The SD Act as in force in 2009 did not make unlawful all sexual
    harassment by a workplace participant. It was only harassment by a
    workplace participant of another workplace participant at a place
    that is a workplace of *both* of those persons which was unlawful
    (s 28B(6)). Item 55 to Schedule 1 of the *Sex and Age Discrimination
    Legislation Amendment Act 2011* (Cth) amended s 28B(6) so as to
    refer to "a workplace of either or both" of the workplace
    participants. However, the transitional provision in item 69 of the
    amending Act means that that amendment is of no effect in the
    present case.

5.  74 The expression "workplace" is defined in s 28B(7) to mean:

A place at which a workplace participant works or otherwise carries out
functions in connection with being a workplace participant.

The Judge was satisfied that the Waterside Hotel and the place in King
Street at which the appellant attempted to kiss the respondent were
workplaces within the statutory definition. In relation to the Waterside
Hotel, the Judge reasoned as follows:

\[228\] The conduct occurred at the Waterside Hotel across the road from
the LLA office and immediately followed the sexual harassment which I
have found occurred at the office. The conduct was part of the same
course of sexual harassment which began in the office. The movement from
the office to the Waterside Hotel was initiated by Mr Vergara as part of
his sexual harassment of Ms Ewin in the office and was acceded to by Ms
Ewin in reaction to that harassment at the office, in an endeavour to
move to a safer place.

\[229\] In that respect at least, the purpose of the attendance and thus
the function there carried out was to deal with the sexual harassment
which began at the workplace. It makes no difference to the existence of
that function that Mr Vergara's purpose was to enlarge the sexual
harassment while Ms Ewin's purpose was to diminish it.

\[230\] For a place at which sexual harassment occurs to satisfy the
statutory definition of "workplace", the function carried out at that
place needed to be "in connection with" Mr Vergara and Ms Ewin being
workplace participants. The phrase "in connection with" used in the s
28B(7) definition of "workplace" is a phrase of wide import. The words
require a mere relation between one thing and another and do not
necessarily require a causal relationship between the two things: *Our
Town FM Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal *(1987) 16 FCR 465 at
479 (Wilcox J).

\[231\] The relation between what Mr Vergara and Ms Ewin were doing at
the Waterside Hotel and each being a workplace participant is
established by the fact that the sexual harassment at the LLA office was
workplace based harassment and that Ms Ewin and Mr Vergara moved to the
Waterside Hotel to deal with that incident of harassment. Those matters
establish a sufficient connection to the workplace to render the
Waterside Hotel a "workplace" for the purposes of s 28B(6) during the
course of Mr Vergara's and Ms Ewin's attendance at that place.

1.  75 As can be seen, the Judge concluded that the appellant and the
    respondent had moved to the Waterside Hotel "to deal with" the
    earlier harassment in the LLA office and, accordingly, were carrying
    out functions "in connection with" being workplace participants.

2.  76 In relation to the kissing incident, the Judge held that the
    street in which that occurred had "a sufficient workplace nexus" and
    satisfied the statutory definition of "workplace" for the same
    reasons which he had given in relation to the Waterside Hotel (at
    \[232\]).

3.  77 The appellant contended that on a proper construction of the
    definition of "workplace", neither the Waterside Hotel nor King
    Street should have been regarded as "a workplace" for the purposes
    of s 28B(6). His submission was that, giving the definition of
    "workplace" a liberal construction as is appropriate for remedial
    legislation, it could not reasonably be said that, while at the
    Waterside Hotel and in King Street, either he or the respondent were
    carrying out functions in connection with being workplace
    participants. He accepted that the first incident in the LLA office
    was at a workplace as defined.

4.  78 As is well established, the process of statutory construction
    must commence with the words actually used and take account of the
    context and purpose of the provisions in question: *Alcan (NT)
    Alumina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Territory Revenue (NT) *\[2009\]
    HCA 41 at \[47\]; (2009) 239 CLR 27 at 46-7; *Commissioner of
    Taxation v Consolidated Media Holdings Ltd *\[2012\] HCA 55 at
    \[39\]; (2012) 293 ALR 257 at 268-9.

5.  79 Some features of s 28B may be noted. Section 28B makes unlawful
    sexual harassment in six circumstances. In the first five
    circumstances, nothing turns on the location at which the harassment
    occurs. However, as I have said, subs (6) limits the proscription of
    sexual harassment by one workplace participant (being an employer,
    employee, commission agent, contract worker or partner in a
    partnership) of another workplace participant to places which are
    workplaces of both. Thus, the operation of subs (6) turns not on the
    relationship between the workplace participants but on the
    circumstance that the conduct occurs at a place in which they are
    both engaged in activities of a defined kind.

6.  80 The definition of "workplace" has two limbs: referring first to
    the place at which a workplace participant works; and, secondly, to
    a place at which a workplace participant otherwise carries out
    functions in connection with being a workplace participant. The
    Judge's findings in this case turned on the second of these limbs.

7.  81 The word "function" is defined in s 4 of the SD Act to include
    "duty". That is an inclusive definition. The word is generally
    understood as meaning "the kind of action or activity proper to a
    person, thing or institution": *Macquarie Dictionary*.

8.  82 In my opinion, the expression "otherwise carries out functions in
    connection with being a workplace participant" should be construed
    as a composite provision having regard to each of its elements. It
    refers to a place, other than that at which the workplace
    participant works, at which the person carries out an activity of
    the requisite character. It may be a fixed or moving location, as
    the definition of "place" indicates. A function of the requisite
    type may be carried out at a place regularly, infrequently or on a
    single occasion only. As the trial Judge noted at \[38\], the two
    limbs in the definition of "workplace" recognise that work or
    work-based functions are commonly undertaken in a wide range of
    places (including on various means of transport) beyond the
    principal or ordinary place or places of work of workplace
    participants.

9.  83 The requirement that a workplace be a place at which workplace
    participants carry out functions in connection with being a
    workplace participant indicates that a place at which the
    participant happens to be, or to which the participant goes, will
    not necessarily be a workplace: it must in addition be a place at
    which the participant "carries out functions" in connection with
    being a workplace participant. The words "carries out" and
    "function" imply the performance of some acts required, expected or
    authorised by the person's employment, agency, contract or
    partnership. The words "in connection with" indicate that the
    requirement, expectation or authority need not be express nor
    direct. It is sufficient if the function being carried out is "in
    connection with" the person being a workplace participant. Adapting
    the language of Cory J in *Flieger v New Brunswick *\[1993\] 2 SCR
    651 at 663-4, the place must be a location at which the person
    carries out some aspect of "the bundle of responsibilities, duties
    and activities" connected with being a person in one of the defined
    work categories.

10. 84 The question of whether a particular location is a place at which
    a workplace participant carries out functions in connection with
    being a workplace participant is a question of fact to be determined
    in accordance with the understanding I have outlined. It means that
    one must be able to identify a function or functions in connection
    with being a workplace participant being carried out by each of the
    participants at the location in question.

11. 85 As noted earlier, the Judge found (at \[231\]) that the Waterside
    Hotel was a "workplace" for the purposes of s 28B(6) while the
    appellant and the respondent were there on 13 May 2009 because each
    was a workplace participant; because the appellant had earlier
    sexually harassed the respondent at the LLA office; and because they
    had moved to the Waterside Hotel "to deal with that incident of
    harassment". The Judge's statement that the appellant and the
    respondent had moved to the hotel "to deal with that incident of
    harassment" has to be understood in the context of the Judge's
    earlier factual findings. Those findings indicate that the Judge was
    not intending to convey that either the appellant or the respondent
    was going to the hotel in order to confront or address the issue, in
    the sense of the respondent admonishing or counselling the
    applicant. The Judge's earlier findings indicate only that the
    respondent, as a result of being frightened, had agreed to the
    appellant's request that she talk to him and wanted that
    conversation to take place in a safer location, i.e., where they
    were not alone. It was in that sense that the Judge concluded that
    they had gone to the hotel to "deal with" the earlier incident of
    harassment.

12. 86 I consider that it is difficult to characterise the activity of
    the respondent at the Waterside Hotel as the carrying out of a
    function in connection with her being an employee of LLA. She does
    not appear then to have been engaged in any activity required,
    expected or authorised by her employment, nor does she appear to
    have been carrying out some aspect of the bundle of
    responsibilities, duties and activities of that employment. However,
    it is not necessary to reach a concluded view about that because
    s 28B(6) as in force in 2009 prohibited sexual harassment of one
    workplace participant by another only at a place which was a
    workplace of both.

13. 87 In my respectful opinion, it cannot reasonably be concluded that
    on the night of 13 May 2009 the appellant was carrying out any
    function at the Waterside Hotel in connection with his contract work
    or in connection with his being a contract worker. He was there
    solely to importune the respondent for sexual favours. It seems to
    be implicit in \[229\] of the Judge's reasons that the appellant's
    sole "function" at the hotel was his sexual pursuit of the
    respondent. It cannot be said that, by accompanying the respondent
    to the hotel, the appellant was complying with an implicit direction
    from the respondent in her capacity as his superior.

14. 88 In my respectful opinion, the Judge focussed inappropriately on
    the *connection* between the events in the Waterside Hotel and the
    events at the LLA office and did not identify, as required by
    s 28B(6) and the definition of "workplace", any *function* being
    carried out by each of the appellant and the respondent in
    connection with their being workplace participants.

15. 89 It is not necessary to express a view on the respondent's
    submission that a place to which two workplace participants go for
    the "maintenance of a proper working relationship" will be a
    workplace as defined. On any view, on the Judge's findings, the
    appellant was not at the Waterside Hotel for such a purpose.

16. 90 As already noted, s 28(6) limits the proscription of sexual
    harassment by workplace participants to places which are the
    workplaces of both. The Waterside Hotel on 13 May cannot be so
    characterised.

17. 91 For similar reasons, I consider that the Judge's conclusion with
    respect to the kissing incident in King Street is also erroneous.

18. 92 Accordingly, I would hold that Ground 6 in the amended notice of
    appeal has been made out and, accordingly, that only the incident of
    harassment which occurred in the LLA office on 13 May 2009 was a
    contravention of s 28B(6) of the SD Act. The declaration made by the
    Judge with respect to the incidents on 3 May 2009 should be varied
    so as to reflect this conclusion.

    1.  **The relationship between appellant and respondent**




1.  93 By Ground 7 of the amended notice of appeal, the appellant
    contended that the Judge had failed to take into account a relevant
    consideration, namely his relationship with the respondent. Counsel
    contended that although the Judge had acknowledged that the
    respondent was the appellant's supervisor, he had not adverted to
    the significance of this relationship when determining whether the
    appellant's conduct constituted sexual harassment or when
    determining the award of compensation.

2.  94 In my opinion, this ground of appeal has no merit. It appeared
    during counsel's submissions that the complaint was based on a
    misconception. Counsel referred to s 28A(1A), which provides:

(1A) For the purposes of subsection (1), the circumstances to be taken
into account include, but are not limited to, the following:

\(a\) the sex, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex
status, marital or relationship status, religious belief, race, colour,
or national or ethnic origin, of the person harassed;

\(b\) the relationship between the person harassed and the person who
made the advance or request or who engaged in the conduct;

\(c\) any disability of the person harassed;

\(d\) any other relevant circumstance.

Counsel emphasised subpar (b) which requires that the relationship
between the person harassed and the person engaging in the harassing
conduct be taken into account.

1.  95 However, subs (1A) was inserted into the SD Act by Sch 1, item 54
    of the *Sex and Age Discrimination Legislation Amendment Act 2011
    *(Cth). The amendments effected by that schedule apply only to acts
    or omissions occurring after the commencement of the schedule, i.e.,
    on 21 June 2011 (Sch 1, item 69). Accordingly, s 28A(1A) has no
    application in the present case.

2.  96 Even if that were not so, I would still regard the ground as
    being without merit. The issue is whether a reasonable person would
    have *anticipated* the *possibility* that the person harassed would
    be offended, humiliated or intimidated.

3.  97 In the present case, the first incident of harassment on 13 May
    2009 comprised the appellant's sexual propositioning of the
    respondent in explicit and crude terms. The appellant's conduct on
    this occasion was markedly different from anything which had
    occurred previously between the appellant and the respondent, and no
    question of the drawing of some inference from the previous
    response, or absence of response, from the respondent arises. I have
    refrained from setting out in these reasons the actual words used by
    the appellant, on the basis that it is unnecessary to do so.
    However, in my opinion, it is plain that a reasonable person hearing
    those words would have anticipated the possibility, at the very
    least, that the respondent would be offended, humiliated or
    intimidated by the appellant's conduct, and that that would be so
    irrespective of her status as the appellant's supervisor.

4.  98 In any event, the respondent did not remain mute on 13 May. She
    rejected outright the appellant's advances and told him firmly that
    she would not be having an affair with him. When later the appellant
    tried to kiss the respondent, she pushed him away saying "Don't ever
    touch me again". The respondent described herself variously as being
    "frightened", "shaken", "bewildered" and "terrified" by the
    appellant's conduct on 13 May 2009.

5.  99 On the Judge's findings which, as noted, are not challenged, the
    respondent had not given the appellant any encouragement to continue
    his advances, whether on 13 May or on either of the next two days.
    It is true that she did not, in her capacity as the appellant's
    superior, rebuke or discipline the appellant. However, that is a
    matter of no moment. Given the crudeness of the appellant's
    statements and the firmness of the respondent's rebuff of his
    advances, it could not sensibly be concluded that a reasonable
    person would not have inferred that the respondent would be
    offended, humiliated or intimidated by the appellant's conduct.

6.  100 The Judge was, in any event, conscious that the respondent was
    the appellant's supervisor, referring to that circumstance at
    \[103\], \[105\], \[147\] and at \[568\] at which the Judge
    addressed a submission made by the appellant at trial concerning
    that relationship.

7.  101 Finally, I note that the present submission was not one which
    was made at the trial. Junior counsel for the appellant acknowledged
    that at the trial the appellant had not suggested that the fact that
    the respondent was in a position of power in relation to the
    appellant was relevant to what a reasonable person in his position
    may have anticipated or that it was relevant to the assessment of
    compensation.

8.  102 This ground of appeal should fail.

    1.  **The assessment of the compensation**

9.  103 The appellant appealed against one aspect only of the Judge's
    assessment of compensation. The award of compensation was made up of
    the following heads of loss:

\(a\) Loss of past earning capacity;

\(b\) Loss of future earning capacity;

\(c\) General damages;

\(d\) Past expenses;

\(e\) Future expenses.

1.  104 The assessment was made pursuant to s 46PO(4)(d) of the
    *Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986* (Cth) which permits a
    court making a finding of, amongst other things, sexual harassment,
    to order the respondent to pay to the applicant "damages by way of
    compensation for any loss or damage suffered because of the conduct
    of the respondent".

2.  105 As noted previously, after making allowance for other recoveries
    by the respondent, the Judge entered judgment for her against the
    appellant for the sum of \$210,563 inclusive of interest.

3.  106 The appellant's complaint had its basis in the explanation which
    the Judge gave for rejecting the respondent's claim to an award of
    exemplary damages. The Judge noted that there is a question as to
    whether s 46PO(4) authorises an award of exemplary damages, but
    considered it unnecessary to resolve that question. He referred to
    the principles discussed by Wilcox, O'Loughlin and Lindgren JJ in
    *Sanders v Snell* (1997) 73 FCR 569 at 601 and noted that exemplary
    damages are awarded only when a court is satisfied that the amount
    of compensatory damages has insufficient punitive force (at
    \[683\]). The Judge said (at \[684\]):

In my view the compensatory damages which I propose to award are not
inadequate to punish Mr Vergara for the entirety of his unlawful conduct
and to deter him and others from engaging in similar conduct. The
imposition of an additional sum to facilitate those objectives is
neither necessary nor warranted. On the basis of what I currently
propose to award Ms Ewin, the contention made by Ms Ewin's Counsel that
Mr Vergara needs to be punished because he will not otherwise be
punished is misplaced.

1.  107 The appellant submitted that it could be inferred from this
    passage that the Judge had considered, inappropriately, that
    punishment of him had been relevant to, and taken into account in,
    the assessment of the compensation under s 46PO(4) for the various
    heads of damage which were allowed.

2.  108 In my opinion, this ground of appeal should fail. First, the
    premise on which the submission is based is not sound. It does not
    follow from the circumstance that a compensatory award is
    sufficiently punitive of a contravention of the SD Act that the
    award was calculated by reference to punitive considerations. An
    award which is reached by reference only to compensatory
    considerations may nevertheless be regarded as having a punitive
    effect, especially when the burden of the award is to be borne by an
    individual.

3.  109 Secondly, the appellant's submission involves a reading of
    \[684\] of the Judge's reasons without regard to its context. In the
    preceding paragraphs, the Judge had referred to several of the
    principles relating to an award of exemplary damages. In the
    paragraph immediately preceding that on which the appellant's
    submission was based, the Judge said:

\[A\]ssuming that I have the power to impose an impost upon Mr Vergara
for the purpose of punishment and deterrence, I would not do so for the
same reasons that in tort an award of exemplary damages would not be
made in circumstances such as the present. As Wilcox, O'Loughlin and
Lindgren JJ explained in *Sanders v Snell* (1997) 73 FCR 569 at 601,
exemplary damages will only be awarded if a court is satisfied that the
quantum of the compensatory damages awarded has insufficient punitive
force. Exemplary damages will be awarded "if, but only if", the sum
awarded as compensatory damages is inadequate to punish the wrongdoer
for his or her conduct.

1.  110 As can be seen, the Judge referred specifically to the principle
    that exemplary damages are awarded only when a Court is satisfied
    that the amount of the compensatory damages has insufficient
    punitive effect.

2.  111 This was an application of orthodox principle. In *Rookes v
    Barnard* \[1964\] AC 1129 at 1228, Lord Devlin said:

In a case in which exemplary damages are appropriate, *a jury should be
directed that if, but only if, the sum which they have in mind to award
as compensation (which may of course, be a sum aggravated by the way in
which the defendant has behaved to the plaintiff) is inadequate to
punish him for his outrageous conduct*, to mark their disapproval of
such conduct and to deter him from repeating it, then it can award some
larger sum. If a verdict given on such a direction has to be reviewed
upon appeal, the appellate court will first consider whether the award
can be justified as compensation and, if it can, there is nothing
further to be said. If it cannot, the court must consider whether or not
the punishment is, in all the circumstances, excessive.

(Emphasis added)

1.  112 Although other aspects of Lord Devlin's reasons in *Rookes v
    Barnard* have been disapproved (see, for example, *Uren v John
    Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd *(1966) 117 CLR 118), the quoted passage has
    been applied in Australia: *Backwell v AAA* \[1997\] 1 VR 182;
    *Sanders v Snell *(1997) 73 FCR 569 at 601. In the latter case, the
    Full Court of this Court said that "\[e\]xemplary damages, which are
    awarded as punishment and deterrence, will be awarded *only if* the
    Court ... is satisfied that the quantum of the compensatory damages
    does not contain any or any sufficient element of punitive damages"
    (emphasis added). The decision in *Sanders v Snell* was overturned
    on appeal by the High Court on other grounds without the High Court
    addressing this aspect of the reasons of the Full Court (*Sanders v
    Snell* \[1998\] HCA 64; (1998) 196 CLR 329).

2.  113 Finally, as junior counsel for the appellant acknowledged, the
    reasons which the Judge gave for his award do not contain any
    indication that the Judge had regard to other than compensatory
    considerations. In particular, there is no indication that the Judge
    reached his compensatory award by reference to punitive
    considerations.

3.  114 In my opinion, this ground of appeal fails.

    1.  **Is re-assessment necessary?**

4.  115 It remains to consider whether the upholding by this Court of
    Ground 6 should have any effect on the Judge's award of
    compensation. Junior counsel for the appellant submitted initially
    that, if Ground 6 was upheld, the matter should be remitted to the
    trial Judge for reassessment. However, counsel acknowledged that
    this Court could itself engage in any re-assessment which may be
    required. Counsel for the respondent contended that in the interests
    of efficiency and closure of litigation, this Court itself should
    engage in any re-assessment which may be required.

2.  116 In making his award, the Judge did not consider or differentiate
    between the four incidents of sexual harassment which he found
    proved. Prima facie, this could suggest that the award did include
    compensation for the effects of the incidents of sexual harassment
    occurring on 13 May 2009 away from the LLA office, which I would set
    aside.

3.  117 However, the Judge's reasons indicate that he regarded the loss
    and damage suffered by the respondent for which the award of
    compensation was appropriate as resulting from the intercourse and
    sexual touching which had occurred on the evening of 15 May 2009,
    rather than from the earlier incidents. The following passages in
    the Judge's reasons indicate that this is so:

\[608\] The unchallenged medical evidence was that as a result of what
occurred on the evening of 15 May, in relation to which \[the
respondent\] believed that she had been raped, \[the respondent\]
suffered PTSD and depression.

\[609\] ... Prof Dennerstein \[a psychiatrist\] diagnosed \[the
respondent\] as suffering from PTSD as a result of what she referred to
as the "harassment and rape" which took place at \[the respondent's\]
workplace. ...

...

\[615\] I am satisfied that \[the respondent\] resigned from her
employment with LLA with effect from 25 September 2009 because of the
impact upon her of Mr Vergara's physical sexual harassment on the
evening of 15 May.

...

\[652\] There can be no doubt that \[the respondent\] has suffered
greatly as a result of the sexual harassment inflicted upon her. Her
immediate physical injuries included pain to her back and neck but her
psychological injuries have been far more severe, having endured for
over 3 years and being likely to continue for some time.

1.  118 Although some of these passages are equivocal, in my opinion
    they indicate that the Judge regarded the respondent's loss and
    damage as resulting from the act of physical sexual harassment
    rather than the earlier incidents of verbal harassment. Further, I
    regard it as significant that the Judge did not identify any
    separate or additional losses resulting from the incidents of verbal
    harassment. The potential of those earlier incidents to have caused
    the respondent loss is not to be gainsaid, but the appellant's
    conduct on the evening of 15 May 2009 in engaging in unwanted sexual
    intercourse with, and sexual touching of, the respondent was
    obviously a much more significant event. The Judge's findings
    indicate that he regarded the respondent's losses as resulting from
    that conduct.

2.  119 On that basis, I consider that the circumstance that Ground 6 is
    upheld and the findings of sexual harassment in contravention of
    s 28B of the SD Act in respect of the incidents away from the LLA
    office on 13 May 2009 are set aside does not warrant any revision of
    the Judge's compensatory award.

    1.  **Conclusion**

3.  120 It has not been necessary to consider grounds 8 and 10 of the
    Amended Notice of Appeal as the appellant did not pursue those
    grounds.

2.  121 For the reasons given above, I would set aside the first of the
    declarations made in the Judge's order of 19 December 2013 and
    substitute a declaration as follows:

On 13 May 2009, by the conduct recorded at sub-paragraph (ii) of
paragraph 222 of the Court's reasons for judgment of 5 December 2013
("the Reasons") the respondent engaged in unwelcome conduct of a sexual
nature and thereby sexually harassed the applicant, in contravention of
s 28B(6) of the *Sex Discrimination Act 1984 *(Cth) ("the Act").

**REASONS FOR JUDGMENT**

**NORTH AND PAGONE JJ**

1.  123 We have had the advantage of reading a draft of the judgment of
    White J and respectfully agree and adopt every aspect of his
    Honour's reasons except those in respect of the characterisation of
    the function carried out at the Waterside Hotel on the night of
    13 May 2009 in which his Honour took a different view from that
    taken by the judge at first instance.

2.  124 The learned primary judge had concluded that the events at the
    Waterside Hotel fell within the definition of "workplace". His
    Honour's conclusions in this respect were:

227 The third incident on 13 May (recorded at (iii)) undoubtedly
involved the making of unwelcome sexual advances, unwelcome requests for
sexual favours and other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. A
reasonable person would have anticipated that Ms Ewin would be offended,
humiliated or intimidated, as indeed she was.

228 The conduct occurred at the Waterside Hotel across the road from the
LLA office and immediately followed the sexual harassment which I have
found occurred at the office. The conduct was part of the same course of
sexual harassment which began in the office. The movement from the
office to the Waterside Hotel was initiated by Mr Vergara as part of his
sexual harassment of Ms Ewin in the office and was acceded to by Ms Ewin
in reaction to that harassment at the office, in an endeavour to move to
a safer place.

229 In that respect at least, the purpose of the attendance and thus the
function there carried out was to deal with the sexual harassment which
began at the workplace. It makes no difference to the existence of that
function that Mr Vergara's purpose was to enlarge the sexual harassment
while Ms Ewin's purpose was to diminish it.

230 For a place at which sexual harassment occurs to satisfy the
statutory definition of "workplace", the function carried out at that
place needed to be "in connection with" Mr Vergara and Ms Ewin being
workplace participants. The phrase "in connection with" used in the s
28B(7) definition of "workplace" is a phrase of wide import. The words
require a mere relation between one thing and another and do not
necessarily require a causal relationship between the two things: *Our
Town FM Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal* (1987) 16 FCR 465 at
479 (Wilcox J).

231 The relation between what Mr Vergara and Ms Ewin were doing at the
Waterside Hotel and each being a workplace participant is established by
the fact that the sexual harassment at the LLA office was workplace
based harassment and that Ms Ewin and Mr Vergara moved to the Waterside
Hotel to deal with that incident of harassment. Those matters establish
a sufficient connection to the workplace to render the Waterside Hotel a
"workplace" for the purposes of s 28B(6) during the course of Mr
Vergara's and Ms Ewin's attendance at that place.

232 The fourth incident which occurred on 13 May (recorded at (iv))
involving Mr Vergara trying to kiss Ms Ewin in King Street after they
left the Waterside Hotel also involved the making of an unwelcome sexual
advance or other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. That conduct also
formed part of the same course of conduct which began with the sexual
harassment at the LLA office earlier that same evening. Having regard,
in particular, to Ms Ewin's prior rejection of Mr Vergara's sexual
advances, a reasonable person having regard to the circumstances would
have anticipated that Ms Ewin would be offended, humiliated or
intimidated. In my view, the place at which the conduct occurred had a
sufficient workplace nexus and satisfied the statutory definition of
"workplace" for the same reasons as those that pertain to the finding I
have made in relation to the Waterside Hotel.

233 For those reasons, I am satisfied that in relation to the conduct
dealt with in each of (ii), (iii) and (iv) of \[222\], Mr Vergara
contravened s 28B(6) of the SD Act.

His Honour's decision was based upon a construction of the definition of
"workplace" as applicable to s 28B(6) which brought within the compass
of a relevant workplace a place where both Mr Vergara and Ms Ewin were
carrying out a function in connection with their being workplace
participants. In that regard his Honour had found on the evidence that
what had occurred at the Waterside Hotel was a continuation of the
sexual harassment which had begun at the LLA office and that the two had
moved to the Waterside Hotel "to deal with that incident of harassment".

1.  125 Section 28B(6) makes it unlawful for a workplace participant
    sexually to harass another workplace participant at "a place that is
    a workplace of both of those persons". A workplace for these
    purposes is defined by s 28B(7) widely to include a place (itself
    intended to apply widely) where the workplace participant "carries
    out functions in connection with being a workplace participant". The
    prohibition in s 28B(6), however, requires that it be a workplace of
    both workplace participants and, therefore, relevantly, that they
    are both at a place carrying out "functions in connection with being
    a workplace participant".

2.  126 His Honour at first instance concluded that the Waterside Hotel
    was a workplace of both Ms Ewin and Mr Vergara because they were
    there "to deal with the sexual harassment which had begun" at the
    office. Determining the function both were carrying out at that
    place on that occasion is to be determined objectively rather than
    by the subjective purpose of either workplace participant. It may be
    that the subjective motive of Mr Vergara was solely to importune Ms
    Ewin for sexual favours but what caused them to be there, as his
    Honour the primary judge found, was that the reason for being at the
    place was to deal at a safer place with the harassment which Mr
    Vergara had commenced at the office. A difficulty for that finding
    may have been that Ms Ewin did not say that expressly to Mr Vergara;
    however, there was ample evidence before his Honour of Ms Ewin
    rejecting Mr Vergara's sexual advances and of having previously made
    it clear to him that she did not want those advances to continue and
    did not then (at the office) want to accept them. The evidence
    available to his Honour could not have supported a finding that Ms
    Ewin encouraged Mr Vergara at the office when she agreed to leave
    the office to go the Waterside Hotel. His Honour found at \[175\]:

After commenting that he just wanted to see the view, Mr Vergara then
walked over to turn the lights on and said, "I'll only turn the lights
on if you agree to come and talk to me about something. I want to tell
you something". Ms Ewin said her response to Mr Vergara was, "Fine, we
will go to the hotel across the road". She deposed that she was
frightened and angry and frustrated and wanted to get out of there to
somewhere safe where there were other people. Her evidence was that she
suggested going to the Waterside Hotel and did so because there was a
teller machine there and she wanted to take out money to give to Mr
Vergara to stop him saying to her, "You owe me".

His Honour later concluded at \[222(ii)\] that Ms Ewin had agreed to go
with Mr Vergara to the hotel as "a result of being frightened and
wanting to go to a safer place" after he had commenced sexual harassment
of her at the office but, of course, neither her uncommunicated
subjective state of mind nor his subjective state of mind can be
determinative of what function the two were performing at the Waterside
Hotel. However, and as his Honour found, her agreeing to go with him was
not because she was accepting his advances. Mr Vergara could not, in the
circumstances, have thought that she was acceding to his wishes. The
objective conclusion drawn by his Honour was that the two were moving
from the office because the hotel was a safer place. The way in which
the harassment was being "dealt with" was by Ms Ewin removing herself
from a place where she had little control to one where his advances
could be controlled by the impact of third party gaze.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1.  127 There can be no doubt that Mr Vergara's motive in acting as  |
|     he did was to importune Ms Ewin for sexual favours and that he,  |
|     subjectively, had no interest or intention to deal with the      |
|     unacceptable workplace relations which Ms Ewin sought to deal    |
|     with. His Honour did not conclude otherwise, but rather, that    |
|     whatever his subjective motive may have been, what was occurring |
|     was the continuation of Ms Ewin's need and attempt to deal with  |
|     the sexual harassment which had begun at the office. That        |
|     conclusion was open on the evidence and on the terms of the      |
|     relevant legislation. The provisions are not made to depend upon |
|     the subjective intention of the parties although subjective      |
|     intention may be relevant to the proper characterisation of the  |
|     objective functions being carried out. As his Honour the primary |
|     judge said at \[229\], however, it "makes no difference to the   |
|     existence of that function that Mr Vergara's purpose was to      |
|     enlarge the sexual harassment while Ms Ewin's purpose was to     |
|     diminish it". It was open to his Honour to conclude that a place |
|     may be the workplace of a participant in circumstances where one |
|     may be carrying out a function imposed by the other. His Honour  |
|     accepted the evidence that Ms Ewin had made clear that she did   |
|     not wish Mr Vergara's advances and that the activities at the    |
|     office and thereafter at the hotel were dealing with the working |
|     relationship which had been affected by Mr Vergara's repeated    |
|     sexual advances.                                                 |
|                                                                      |
| 2.  128 The appellant did not challenge his Honour's findings of     |
|     fact but rather, contended that the facts found could not amount |
|     to the carrying out by both Ms Ewin and Mr Vergara of functions  |
|     in connection with being a workplace participant. The facts, as  |
|     found, however were that Ms Ewin did not go to the Waterside     |
|     Hotel in acceptance of Mr Vergara's sexual advances but, on the  |
|     contrary, because she wanted to deal with what she had           |
|     repeatedly sought to discourage. The evidence of the             |
|     commencement of the series of events made clear that Mr Vergara  |
|     was seeking to have Ms Ewin change her reaction to him: it was   |
|     not the continuation of a mutual relationship but the            |
|     continuation of his attempts to importune her in the knowledge   |
|     of her unwillingness to participate in the conduct he sought     |
|     from her. In that regard his Honour had the benefit of hearing   |
|     the whole of the evidence and of the impression which that       |
|     evidence would have made upon him. It being open to his Honour   |
|     to find, and there being no challenge to the facts found, that   |
|     going to the Waterside Hotel was triggered by a need to deal     |
|     with the resumption of Mr Vergara's unwanted sexual advances, it |
|     was open for his Honour to hold that the function of both at     |
|     that place was to deal with what had commenced at the workplace. |
|                                                                      |
| 3.  129 Accordingly we would also dismiss the appeal.                |
|                                                                      |
| I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a     |
| true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable       |
| Justices North and Pagone.                                           |

|                                                                      |
