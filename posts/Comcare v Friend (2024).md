> **REASONS FOR JUDGMENT**
> 
> **WHEELAHAN J:**

1. The respondent to this appeal was an employee of the Australian Federal Police (**AFP**) until her employment was terminated in 2019 on the ground of invalidity. In March 2014, she lodged a claim for compensation with the appellant (**Comcare**) pursuant to the _[Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988](https://jade.io/article/218564)_ [(Cth)](https://jade.io/article/218564) (**[SRC Act](https://jade.io/article/218564)**). Subsequently, Comcare accepted the respondent’s claim as a result of which she received compensation in the form of medical expenses and weekly payments on the ground of incapacity in the total sum of $677,363.84.
    
2. In August 2018, the respondent lodged a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission (**AHRC complaint**) alleging discrimination on the ground of disability, discrimination on the ground of her sex, and that she had been sexually harassed in the period from March 2013 until early 2014. The four respondents to the AHRC complaint as lodged were the AFP and three AFP employees holding the ranks of Sergeant, Senior Constable, and Probationary Constable.
    
3. In September 2020, the respondent and the Commonwealth of Australia representing the AFP entered into a deed of release under which the AFP agreed to pay the respondent the sum of $1,250,000 in settlement of the AHRC complaint.
    
4. In February 2021, Comcare gave notice of its intention to recover from the respondent the sum of $677,363.84 on the ground that for the purposes of the recovery provision in s [48](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/1622) of the [SRC Act](https://jade.io/article/218564) the respondent would recover damages as a result of the settlement of the AHRC complaint. The respondent disputed that the monies payable to her under the deed of release gave rise to an entitlement by Comcare to recover the statutory compensation. The respondent was successful before the primary judge who made a declaration in the respondent’s favour. The issue on this appeal is whether the primary judge was correct in declaring that no part of the sum of $1,250,000 paid pursuant to the deed of release in settlement of the AHRC complaint constituted “damages or a recovery of damages” within the meaning of s [48](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/1622) of the [SRC Act](https://jade.io/article/218564).
    
    **The legislation**
    
5. The resolution of this appeal requires that attention be directed to the legislation.
    
    **_[Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth)](https://jade.io/article/218564)_**
    
6. When enacted in 1988, the [SRC Act](https://jade.io/article/218564) was titled the _[Commonwealth Employees’ Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988](https://jade.io/article/218564)_. In the second reading speech for the Bill in the House of Representatives, the Minister for Social Security stated that “[p]erhaps the most controversial aspect of the new legislation is that common law actions against the Commonwealth will be replaced by [...] comprehensive benefits”.
    
7. The [SRC Act](https://jade.io/article/218564) provides for the payment of statutory compensation to employees of the Commonwealth, Commonwealth authorities, and licensed private corporations. The term “employee” is defined by s [5(1)](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/1036) of the [SRC Act](https://jade.io/article/218564) as including a person who is employed by the Commonwealth. Relevantly, for the purposes of the Act an AFP employee is to be taken to be employed by the Commonwealth: s [5(2)(a)](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/8700).
    
8. As an element of the scheme, the Act abrogates actions or other proceedings for damages against the Commonwealth, Commonwealth authorities and licensed corporations or an employee in respect of an injury sustained by an employee in the course of employment. The Act does not abrogate claims for damages by employees against other parties.
    
9. There are some definitions in the [SRC Act](https://jade.io/article/218564) that are relevant to the provisions that will be considered. The term “damages” is defined by s 4(1) as follows –
    
    > **_damages_** includes any amount paid under a compromise or settlement of a claim for damages, whether or not legal proceedings have been instituted, but does not include an amount paid in respect of costs incurred in connection with legal proceedings.
    
10. The term “injury” is the subject of the definition in s [5A](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/141352) that incorporates in s [5A(1)(b)](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/34114) a reference to an “injury” in its primary sense –
    
    > **5A    Definition of _injury_**
    > 
    > > (1)       In this Act:
    > > 
    > > > **_injury_** means:
    > > > 
    > > > > (a)          a disease suffered by an employee; or
    > > > > 
    > > > > (b)          an injury (other than a disease) suffered by an employee, that is a physical or mental injury arising out of, or in the course of, the employee’s employment; or
    > > > > 
    > > > > (c)          an aggravation of a physical or mental injury (other than a disease) suffered by an employee (whether or not that injury arose out of, or in the course of, the employee’s employment), that is an aggravation that arose out of, or in the course of, that employment;
    
    > > > but does not include a disease, injury or aggravation suffered as a result of reasonable administrative action taken in a reasonable manner in respect of the employee’s employment.
    
    > > …
    
11. There is some circularity in relation to the definition of “injury” and the liability to pay compensation that is introduced by s [4(8)](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/13644) of the [SRC Act](https://jade.io/article/218564), which provides –
    
    > > (8)          A reference in this Act to an injury suffered by an employee is, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to an injury suffered by the employee in respect of which compensation is payable under this Act.
    
12. Section [10](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/280) of the [SRC Act](https://jade.io/article/218564) provides for the time at which damages shall be taken to have been recovered –
    
    > **10 Recovery of damages**
    > 
    > > For the purposes of this Act, damages shall be taken to have been recovered by an employee, or by or for the benefit of a dependant of a deceased employee, when the amount of the damages was paid to or for the benefit of the employee or dependant, as the case may be.
    
13. The central provision of the [SRC Act](https://jade.io/article/218564) relating to the entitlement to compensation is s [14](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/290), which provides –
    
    > **14       Compensation for injuries**
    > 
    > > > (1)          Subject to this Part, Comcare is liable to pay compensation in accordance with this Act in respect of an injury suffered by an employee if the injury results in death, incapacity for work, or impairment.
    > > > 
    > > > (2)          Compensation is not payable in respect of an injury that is intentionally self-inflicted.
    > > > 
    > > > (3)          Compensation is not payable in respect of an injury that is caused by the serious and wilful misconduct of the employee but is not intentionally self-inflicted, unless the injury results in death, or serious and permanent impairment.
    
14. Part IV of the [SRC Act](https://jade.io/article/218564) is titled, “Liabilities arising apart from this Act”, and comprises ss [42 to 52A](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/1392463). In relation to the abrogation of actions for damages by a Commonwealth employee against Commonwealth parties, s [44(1)](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/324) of the Act provides –
    
    > **44 Action for damages not to lie against Commonwealth etc. in certain cases**
    > 
    > > > (1)          Subject to section [45](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/954), an action or other proceeding for damages does not lie against the Commonwealth, a Commonwealth authority, a licensed corporation or an employee in respect of:
    > > > 
    > > > > (a)          an injury sustained by an employee in the course of his or her employment, being an injury in respect of which the Commonwealth, Commonwealth authority or licensed corporation would, but for this subsection, be liable (whether vicariously or otherwise) for damages; or
    > > > > 
    > > > > (b)          the loss of, or damage to, property used by an employee resulting from such an injury;
    
    > > > whether that injury, loss or damage occurred before or after the commencement of this section.
    
15. The effect of s [44](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/368) is to deny the existence of a cause of action against a Commonwealth party in respect of an injury that engages s [44(1)(a)](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/7180). This effect is not merely procedural, but substantive: _[Austral Pacific Group Limited (in liq) v Airservices Australia](https://jade.io/article/68207)_ [2000] HCA 39; 203 CLR 136 at [[21]](https://jade.io/article/68207/section/140771) (Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ).
    
16. There are two exceptions to the annihilating effect of s [44(1)](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/324). The first is that it does not abrogate a dependant’s claim: s [44(3)](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/835). The second exception is that an employee may elect not to receive certain payments on account of permanent impairment or non-economic loss, and may sue for damages in relation to the loss to which the election relates: s [45](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/954). There is a cap of $110,000 on such damages: s [45(4)](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/10504).

- **_[Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth)](https://jade.io/article/219680)_**
    
- The _[Sex Discrimination Act](https://jade.io/article/219680)_ provides that a person discriminates against another on the ground of his or her sex if, by reason of the sex of that person, or a characteristic in persons of that sex, the discriminator treats the person less favourably than, in circumstances that are the same or not materially different, the discriminator treats, or would treat, a person of a different sex or imposes, or proposes to impose, a condition, requirement or practice that has, or is likely to have, the effect disadvantaging persons of the same sex as the aggrieved person: s 5. It is also unlawful, by force of s [14(2)](https://jade.io/article/219680/section/6047), for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of the employee’s sex in terms or conditions of employment that the employer affords the employee, by denying, or limiting, the employee’s access for promotion, transfer or training, or to any other benefits associated with employment.
    
- Section [28A](https://jade.io/article/219680/section/2353) of the _[Sex Discrimination Act](https://jade.io/article/219680)_ provides that a person sexually harasses another if he or she makes an unwelcome sexual advance or unwelcome request for sexual favours to the person harassed, or engages in other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in relation to the person harassed in circumstances in which a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated the possibility that the person harassed would be offended, humiliated or intimidated. Conduct of a sexual nature includes the making of a statement of a sexual nature to a person or in the presence of the person, whether the statement is made orally or in writing.
    
- Section [106](https://jade.io/article/219680/section/708) of the _[Sex Discrimination Act](https://jade.io/article/219680)_ provides for a qualified form of vicarious liability. Like the _[Disability Discrimination Act](https://jade.io/article/218296)_, s [9(5)](https://jade.io/article/218296/section/10304) of the _[Sex Discrimination Act](https://jade.io/article/219680)_ provides that s [14](https://jade.io/article/218564/section/290) has effect in relation to discrimination against, and sexual harassment of, Commonwealth employees in connection with their employment as Commonwealth employees. However, while s [108](https://jade.io/article/219680/section/2821) of the _[Sex Discrimination Act](https://jade.io/article/219680)_ replicates s [124](https://jade.io/article/218296/section/957) of the _[Disability Discrimination Act](https://jade.io/article/218296)_, the definition of “Commonwealth employee” in s [4](https://jade.io/article/219680/section/82) of the _[Sex Discrimination Act](https://jade.io/article/219680)_ does not include any reference to an AFP employee. The primary judge observed at J [28] that accordingly, the _[Sex Discrimination Act](https://jade.io/article/219680)_ may not apply to the AFP as an employer.
