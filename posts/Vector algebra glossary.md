1. **Vectors**: Objects with both magnitude and direction. Represented as arrows or as coordinates in a space.
2. **Vector Addition**: Combining two vectors by adding their corresponding components. Result is a new vector.
3. **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiplying a vector by a scalar changes its magnitude but not its direction.
4. **Dot Product**: Scalar result of multiplying corresponding components of two vectors and summing them. Measures the cosine of the angle between vectors.
5. **Cross Product**: Vector perpendicular to two given vectors, with magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors.
6. **Magnitude (Norm)**: Length of the vector, found using the Pythagorean theorem for its components.
7. **Unit Vector**: Vector with a magnitude of 1, indicating direction.
8. **Vector Projection**: Projection of one vector onto another, resulting in a vector in the direction of the second vector.
9. **Basis Vectors**: Set of vectors that, in linear combination, can represent every vector in a given space.
10. **Orthogonality**: Vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero, meaning they are perpendicular.
11. **Vector Spaces**: Collections of vectors that can be scaled and added together, closed under these operations.
12. **Linear Independence**: A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the others.

Understanding these concepts forms the foundation of vector algebra and is crucial for applications in physics, engineering, and computer science.
