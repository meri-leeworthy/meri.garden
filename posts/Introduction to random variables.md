A **random variable** may be defined as a real-valued function over a random experiment's sample space 𝑆. The function's domain is 𝑆, and the real numbers associated with the various possible outcomes of the random experiment constitute the **range** of the function. If the range of the random variable consists of a finite number of countable infinitudes of values, the random variable is classified as **discrete**. The random variable is classified as **continuous** if the range consists of an uncountable infinitude of values. 

Consider an example of a random experiment involving the selection of an item at random from a manufactured lot. Associate $𝑋=0$ with the drawing of a non-defective item and $𝑋=1$ with the drawing of a defective item. Then 𝑋 is a random variable with range (0,1) and therefore discrete. Let 𝑋  denote the successive number of the throw on which the first failure of a switch occurs. Then 𝑋  is a discrete random variable with range $1,2,3,…,𝑛$. Note that the range of 𝑋 consists of a countable infinitude of values and that 𝑋  is, therefore, again discrete. 

Suppose that 𝑋 denotes the time to failure of a bus section in an electrostatic precipitator. Then 𝑋 is a continuous random variable whose range consists of all the real numbers greater than zero. 

The topic of random variables leads to random sampling, leading to the general subject of random numbers. In random sampling, each member of a population has an equal (the same) chance of being selected as a sample.
