The complainants had been racially vilified when they were subjected to repeated racial abuse from their neighbours breaching s 18C of the Racial  and Religious Tolerance Act 2001 (Vic) (RRTA).

- At [51]-[53]: ‘They were inciting anyone who heard their comments to behave in the same way. Their comments by their nature incite serious contempt, severe ridicule and hatred against the Khalils. I am satisfied that the comments were made because of the Khalils' colour and Arabic origin. This applies not only to those comments which were expressly racial in  nature, but also to the obscenities, sexual references and other abuse  which the respondents directed to the Khalils. The comments were made  in a location and loudly enough that I am satisfied that they were intended  to be heard not just by the Khalils but by any neighbour or member of the  public in the vicinity’.
- VCAT ordered the respondents to publish a formal apology in the Herald Sun and pay the complainants compensation totalling $7,000 for loss,  damage or injury suffered.
- VCAT took into account 'the very serious and persistent nature of the respondents' abuse, the need not to trivialise what has happened, the objectives of the Act including to promote participation in a multicultural society, and the great disruption and humiliation caused to the complainants by the conduct of the respondents'
- Compensation payable under s 23C RRTA
