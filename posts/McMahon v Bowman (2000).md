> **WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE DISPUTE?**
> 
> > 1            This application is brought by Warwick Howard McMahon against Ronald Maxwell Bowman pursuant to s.46PO of the _Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cwth)_ [HREOC Act] claiming that he was the subject of racial vilification contrary to s.18C of the _Race Discrimination Act 1975 (Cwth)_  [RDA].

> > 2            It is alleged by the applicant that after his children hit a ball from their property into the neighbouring property owned by the respondent that the respondent made a series of racially offensive remarks addressed to the occupants of the applicant’s house and made further remarks addressed to the applicant himself when the applicant walked over the respondent’s property to retrieve the ball.

> > 3            The respondent disputes the evidence of the applicant and the applicant’s witnesses concerning the words alleged to have been uttered and denies that in all the circumstances the allegations are unlawful within the provisions of s.18C(1) or 18C(2).

...

> > **DECISIONS AND ORDERS**
> 
> > 30.          The Applicant claims compensation which the Court is entitled to award under s.46PO(4)(d) HREOC Act. In considering the appropriate amount of the award the Court has excluded the altercation between Mr Bowman and Mr McMahon. It has done this because the altercation was the subject of proceedings in the local court and Mr McMahon should not be twice punished for his actions. Mr Bowman may have certain rights under State law to compensation in relation to that incident which are intended to compensate him for the hurt and distress he suffered. The Court is of the view that the words, addressed as they were to an entire family including impressionable children, were insulting and demeaning and that an appropriate amount of compensation would be $1,500.

> **COSTS**
> 
> > 31.          The case was heard over two days and if no costs were awarded to the successful applicant the entire benefit of this judgment would be lost.  It is therefore appropriate to order that the respondent pay the applicant’s costs to be taxed if not agreed on the Federal Court scale.  The Federal Magistrates Court when it propounds its rules will include within those rules simplified procedures in relation to costs.  This will include lump sum costs based upon events.  Those rules are not yet promulgated and should have no bearing on any taxation but if the parties wish the Court to make its own binding assessment of costs the Court would be pleased to do so provided it is so requested within seven days.
