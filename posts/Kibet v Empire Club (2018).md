- Kibet was refused entry to a club on numerous occasions.
- Kibet was dark-skinned, and, as he put it, of African appearance. His  companions of that night are white-skinned, except for one who is from an  Indian family. The Applicant’s companions (Caucasian in appearance)  were all admitted to the nightclub. The Applicant was not. He claims he  was discriminated against on the ground of his race: [1]
- Kibet felt hurt and humiliated when denied entry: [24]
- Kibet claimed he suffered social anxiety and had been diagnosed with PTSD and “cut ties with Caucasian friends so as to reduce shame”: [125]
- Kibet sought counselling and produced a letter from his psychologist but  was found not to have suffered long-term psychological injury (he saw the  psychologist only three times): [127], [132]
- Citing _Decker v Victorian Institute of Dryland Agriculture_ [2006] VCAT 299 [5], compensation is available for p sychological injury, humiliation and hurt provided there is a cause or link between the breach and the loss/damage/injury sought. Non-economic loss is hard to quantify. Each case is to be assessed on case by case basis: [128]
- Followed _Jemal v_ _ISS Facility Services Pty Ltd_ [2015] VCAT 103 finding that the award of damages of $3,000 was a “the bottom of the range” for hurt and humiliation: [129]
- $3,000 damages awarded (general – hurt and humiliation): [134] – taking  into account that the applicant was seeking entertainment not a job or  accommodation or essential services: [133]
- Training for staff ordered: [140]-[141]
