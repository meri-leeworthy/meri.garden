CLAIM FOR COMPENSATION FOR LOSS AND DAMAGE DUE TO DISCRIMINATION ON THE GROUNDS OF “EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITY” CONTRARY TO SECTION 18 OF THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY ACT 2010 — Complaint to employer about assault in the workplace — Failure to investigate — Treatment following complaint.

  

## Member L Johnson .

[1]  In this proceeding, Andrew Edmonds claims compensation from his employer, Holmesglen Institute (Holmesglen) for loss and damage due to discrimination in employment, on the grounds of employment activity, contrary to section 18 of the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (EO Act).

[2]  Mr Edmonds was employed by Holmesglen as a teacher of plumbing and mechanical services. He was initially employed in 2006 on a part time basis, and became a full time employee in May 2008. He is still employed by Holmesglen but has been on WorkCover since January 2018.

[3]  On or about 22 September 2015, Mr Edmonds had an altercation with his colleague Phillip Skinner, in which Mr Skinner assaulted Mr Edmonds. The next day Mr Edmonds reported the incident, in person, to the Head of the Plumbing Department at Holmesglen, Dominic Hibbert. Mr Edmonds followed this up the following day, 24 September 2015, with an email. Mr Edmonds says that he sent the email because Mr Hibbert’s initial response caused Mr Edmonds to be concerned that Mr Hibbert would not investigate the incident. Mr Edmonds asserts that his report to Mr Hibbert was “employment activity” within the meaning of the EO Act. Employment activity is one of the protected attributes under the EO Act.

[4]  Mr Edmonds says that, after making this report, he was treated unfavourably by Mr Skinner and by Mr Hibbert from September 2015 to February 2018. Mr Edmonds says that the unfavourable treatment he received amounts to detriment within the meaning of section 18(d) of the EO Act, and that Holmesglen is vicariously liable for the conduct of its employees, Mr Skinner and Mr Hibbert.

[5]  I conducted a hearing in the week commencing 2 December 2019. I heard evidence from Mr Edmonds, his treating psychologist, Dr Jan Heath, consulting psychiatrist Dr Gregor Schutz, consultant psychiatrist Dr Leon Turnbull, Mr Skinner, Patricia Farnes, Assistant Director, Human Resources of Holmesglen, and Jason Jarvis, an employee of Holmesglen who witnessed the altercation. Mr Edmonds’ General Practitioner, Dr Cox also appeared, to produce medical records relating to his treatment of Mr Edmonds, although it proved unnecessary to consider these in detail in the hearing.

[6]  At the conclusion of evidence, I adjourned the proceeding to enable the parties to file and serve written submissions.


## Order

Holmesglen Institute shall pay Andrew Edmonds $25,000 in compensation for injury suffered by him as a consequence of contraventions by Holmesglen Institute of the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 .
