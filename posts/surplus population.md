If surplus population includes indigenous people including people with limited exposure to colonisation or capitalism,

How can the position ‘within capitalism’ be understood

> The theory of surplus population derives from arguments presented by Marx in the first volume of _Capital_, chapter 25 in particular, on the “general law of capitalist accumulation”. Marx defines the surplus population as workers without regular access to work: a worker “belongs to” the surplus population “when he is only partially employed or wholly unemployed”.[4](https://endnotes.org.uk/issues#note_4) Marx refers to this surplus population as a “relative surplus population”, because these workers are not absolutely surplus, as in a Malthusian account (which is to say, it is not a matter of there not being enough food, water, shelter, etc). Instead, these workers are surplus relative to the needs of capital — that is, relative to capital’s demand for labour.
