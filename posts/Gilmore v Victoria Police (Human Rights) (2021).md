## Judge Jenkins , Senior Sessional Member.

NATURE OF APPLICATION

[1]  This proceeding is brought under the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (the EO Act).

[2]  By Application dated 7 January 2020 and accompanying Points of Claim (POC), the Applicant alleges that the Respondent directly discriminated against him in employment, and victimised him, contrary to ss 8, 18 and 104 of the EO Act.

[3]  The Applicant seeks financial compensation for the adverse effect which the Respondent’s behaviour has caused.

[4]  The Application is opposed by the Respondent.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

[5]  For the reasons detailed below, the Tribunal has found that the Respondent discriminated against the Applicant in contravention of s 18(d) of the EO Act by reason that:

- a The Applicant engaged in employment activity;
- b The Respondent treated the Applicant unfavourably because of his attribute of employment activity, and such attribute was at least a substantial reason for such treatment; and
- c The Respondent subjected the Applicant to detriment/s because of his employment activity.

[6]  The Applicant engaged in employment activity by:

- a Making reasonable requests of the Respondent, both orally and in writing, regarding his employment entitlements in regard to a duty failure investigation and finding; and
- b Communicating with the Respondent, both orally and in writing, requesting and/or expressing concern that he had not been, is not being or will not be, given employment entitlements.

[7]  The Applicant relied upon the following employment entitlements in the context of a duty failure allegation, investigation, finding and consequent workplace guidance:

- a The right to be informed of any alleged failure to perform his duties as a police officer;
- b The right to be informed of the evidence upon which the Respondent based a finding of duty failure; and
- c The right to procedural fairness and the opportunity to be heard, including the right to be represented and, if necessary, to challenge any such evidence.

[8]  These employee entitlements arise under the Applicant’s contract of service, which encompasses related employee awards, rules and guidelines (described below), and the Victoria Police Act 2013 (VP Act).

[9]  Whilst engaged in employment activity, the Applicant was denied his employee entitlements in the following circumstances:

- a In the investigation of an incident arising from a third party complaint;
- b In the communication of a duty failure finding;
- c In the recording of adverse entries in his professional records;[1](https://plus.lexis.com/apac/document/?pdmfid=1539278&crid=9074f75f-b2f2-4475-9dab-976234424fe6&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases-au%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A65G5-4H91-F016-S001-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=267716&pdteaserkey=&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&ecomp=s85k&earg=sr18&prid=b3fc14d6-df07-4114-8a35-376960df48d8#)
- d When the Applicant attempted to rely upon a grievance procedure; and
- e When the Applicant sought to have his professional records corrected.

[10]  The Tribunal further found that, in breach of s 104(1)(g) of the EO Act, the Respondent victimised the Applicant by threatening to subject him to disciplinary action because he had alleged discrimination as described above, which was a substantial reason for such threatened treatment.

[11]  In consequence, the Applicant has suffered detriment by way of a prolonged adverse impact to his mental health; delayed financial increments; and a sense of professional insecurity and pessimism for his career prospects, for which he is entitled to be compensated.
