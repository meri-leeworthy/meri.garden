**Applicant:** Ms. Collins, an employee subjected to sexual harassment by her employer, Mr. Smith. 

  

On the question of compensation, the employer raised the issue of whether worker’s compensation legislation fetters the power of VCAT to award compensation under s 125(a)(ii) of the Equal Opportunity Act.

  

Incidents included unwelcome physical contact and inappropriate comments spanning over 4-5 months, Mr. Smith engaged in various inappropriate behaviors, including:

- Making unwelcome sexual advances and propositions.
- Attempting to kiss and touch Ms. Collins inappropriately.
- Sending sexualized text messages.
- Making explicit comments, such as expressing his desire to make love to her.
- Comparing Ms. Collins to a "Lamborghini in the garage" that he couldn't drive, implying she was of no use to him if she didn't comply with his advances.

  

- Resulted in significant psychological distress and impact on her employment.

- The plaintiff claimed that her work hours were reduced, as a result of rejecting Mr. Smith's advances, and she eventually became too distressed to continue her employment. 

- The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) found that Mr. Smith had contravened sections 92, 93, and 125(a)(ii) of the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Vic) by sexually harassing Ms. Collins.
