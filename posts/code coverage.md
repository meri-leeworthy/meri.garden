Code coverage is a metric used in software development to measure the proportion of code that is executed during automated testing. It provides insights into the effectiveness of the test suite by indicating which parts of the codebase have been exercised by the tests and which parts have not.

Code coverage is typically expressed as a percentage and represents the ratio of the number of lines or branches of code that have been executed at least once during testing to the total number of lines or branches in the codebase. The goal of achieving high code coverage is to ensure that a significant portion of the code has been tested, reducing the likelihood of undetected bugs and improving overall software quality.

There are different types of code coverage metrics, including:

- **Line coverage**: Measures the percentage of lines of code that have been executed at least once during testing.
- **Branch coverage**: Focuses on the percentage of decision points (branches) in the code that have been taken during testing. It helps ensure that all possible outcomes of conditional statements have been tested.
- **Statement coverage**: Similar to line coverage, but it considers individual statements rather than entire lines of code.
- **Function coverage**: Measures the percentage of functions or methods that have been invoked during testing.

Code coverage tools and frameworks can help developers track and visualize code coverage metrics. While achieving high code coverage is a positive sign, it's important to note that high code coverage doesn't guarantee the absence of bugs or that all possible scenarios have been tested. It's just one of many metrics used to assess the quality of a test suite. Effective testing also involves considering different test cases, edge cases, and scenarios to ensure comprehensive coverage of the application's behaviour.
