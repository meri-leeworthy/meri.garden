#### 1.1. Introduction to Set theory

In this topic, you will learn the terminologies used in set theory, the standard formats used, what objects are, etc.

**A set** is a collection of objects. These objects in a set are called elements of the set.

e.g. A set of prime numbers between 2 & 20 can be written as {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19}{2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19}


**Objects in a set have no order.** Therefore, the order in which we describe objects in a set does not matter.

e.g. The set of prime numbers between 2 & 20 can be written as {7,19,5,2,17,13,11,3}{7,19,5,2,17,13,11,3}


**A set can only contain unique objects.** Notation-wise, it is a convention to use capital letters such as A, B, C etc., to denote the name of a set.

e.g. 𝑃={2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19}𝑃={2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19}


**We use { and } to enclose all elements of a set.** We say an element a belongs to the set A if a is an element of A. (Notation: a _<is a member of symbol>_ A)

e.g. 𝑃={2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19}𝑃={2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19}, hence 7∈𝑃7∈𝑃 and 8∉𝑃8∉𝑃


**We can describe a set using enumerated form or using set builder form.**

e.g. 𝑃={2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19}𝑃={2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19} or 𝑃={𝑥|2≤𝑥≤20,𝑥 is a prime}𝑃={𝑥|2≤𝑥≤20,𝑥 is a prime}


As in the previous example, the **enumerated form** will explicitly list out all members of a set. The enumerated form is also called the Tabular form or Roaster form.

e.g. 𝐴={1,2,3,4,5}𝐴={1,2,3,4,5}


**Set builder form** will describe the members by listing all conditions an object needs to fulfil to be a member of the set.

e.g. 𝐴={𝑥|0<𝑥<6,𝑥 is integer}
