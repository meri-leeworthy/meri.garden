**HUMAN RIGHTS** – discrimination – sexual harassment – where the applicant alleged that her employer had repeatedly engaged in sexual harassment by the conduct of its principal and sole director, by giving her numerous gifts, slapping her on the buttock, making various comments to her about her appearance orally and in text messages, declaring his affection for her and raising the matter again after she had told him she was not interested – whether all the alleged gifts were gifts or were unsolicited — whether any of the gifts were unwelcome – whether the applicant was slapped on the buttocks – whether comments and declarations of affection were made and whether they were unsolicited – whether any of the conduct amounted to “an unwelcome sexual advance or “other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” within the meaning of s [28A](https://jade.io/article/219680/section/2353) of the _[Sex Discrimination Act 1984](https://jade.io/article/219680)_ [(Cth)](https://jade.io/article/219680) – whether, if so, the conduct occurred in circumstances in which a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated the possibility that the applicant would be offended, humiliated or intimidated

**DAMAGES** – where applicant exhibited symptoms of anxiety and depression after the conduct complained of and there was no dispute she had a psychiatric disorder which had not previously been diagnosed, whether respondents’ conduct caused the disorder – what damages should be awarded – whether applicant entitled to aggravated damages

- In determining an appropriate award in the present case, I take into account the following matters.  Ms Taylor is a young woman who has developed a chronic psychiatric disorder caused by the respondents’ conduct.  As a result, she has experienced depression and anxiety, disturbed sleep, reduced energy, poor concentration, lack of motivation, loss of appetite and a reduction in social contact.  She also grieves the loss of her career and the damage she perceives has been done to her reputation.  On the other hand, she has improved.  She appears to be in a stable and supportive relationship with her partner and she has returned to the workforce.  She is obviously a talented and resourceful woman.  In my opinion, her condition is likely to continue to improve with the assistance of psychological care once this proceeding concludes.
    
- In view of the effect on Ms Taylor and the prognosis of the psychiatrists, I consider that an award of $250,000 in general damages for the sexual harassment and an additional $50,000 for the victimisation would be manifestly excessive.  It would not be compensatory but punitive.  I would award Ms Taylor **$140,000 for the sexual harassment and $40,000 for the victimisation**.

...

- I would award **$15,000 in aggravated damages**.  In doing so, I make no allowance for the conduct of the defence of the proceeding.
    
- The respondents’ defence of the proceeding was described by counsel in written submissions as “appalling, unjustifiable and improper”.  Reference was made to the denials that several of the gifts were “unsolicited”, when the evidence indicated otherwise and it was never put to Ms Taylor that she had solicited them, “presumably because there was no evidentiary basis to do so”.  While this conduct was imprudent, perhaps foolish, I do not think it was improper, unjustifiable or lacking in bona fides.

...

Taking all these matters into account, I would award a total of $3,000 for future out-of-pocket expenses.

...

Ultimately there was no dispute about the calculations in the figures for future economic loss.  They are $39,667.94 for lost earnings or lost earning capacity over a period of three years and $9,051.39 in superannuation.

...

- As I have said, the psychiatrists were guarded in their optimism.  On balance, I would make only a modest discount of 5%.  That would result in a reduction of the amount claimed for future lost earnings to $37,684.55, which I would round up to $37,685, and $8,598.82 for lost superannuation benefits which I would round up to $8,599.
    
    **_Interest_**
    
- Interest should be paid on past losses to the date of judgment in accordance with s 51A of the FCA Act.  Interest should be paid on past general damages from 6 January 2020 at the rate of 2% per annum (see _[Gill v Ethicon Sàrl](https://jade.io/article/675422)_ [2019] FCA 1905 at [[5131]](https://jade.io/article/675422/section/66268)). In view of the prognosis, I would allocate 70% of the general damages to the past. I award interest on past economic loss, including paid out-of-pocket expenses, from 11 August 2020 at the rates prescribed by Practice Note GPN-INT.
