L'Hôpital's rule is a method in calculus for finding the limit of indeterminate forms. It applies primarily to forms like $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$. The rule states that if you have a limit of the form $\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$, and both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ approach 0 or $\pm \infty$ as $x$ approaches $c$, then:

$$
\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
$$

provided the limit on the right-hand side exists. Here, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are the derivatives of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, respectively. This process can be repeated if the resulting limit is still an indeterminate form.

## example 
Sure, let's consider the limit:

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}
$$

As $x$ approaches 0, both $\sin(x)$ and $x$ approach 0, resulting in an indeterminate form $\frac{0}{0}$. We can apply L'Hôpital's rule here.

First, we take the derivatives of the numerator and the denominator:

- The derivative of $\sin(x)$ is $\cos(x)$.
- The derivative of $x$ is 1.

Now we apply L'Hôpital's rule:

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(x)}{1}
$$

As $x$ approaches 0, $\cos(x)$ approaches 1. Therefore, the limit is:

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(x)}{1} = 1
$$

So,

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1
$$
