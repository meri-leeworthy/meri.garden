[[Leaf]]
[[Roomy]]
[[Weird]]

## Potential things I could be doing right now
- Creating a mini version of Roomy to play with the SDK
- Running Weird and experimenting with static generation and offloading cache to object storage
- Modelling Rich Text in Leaf and trying to work out how to apply Rich Text operations in Roomy
- Writing a proposal for centralised component schema registry (probably just a github repo)
- Finishing my writeup on [[Leaf Render Update 0]] and posting my vid & some writing to instagram & substack
