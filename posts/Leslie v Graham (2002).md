> **INTRODUCTION**

1. The applicant (“Ms Leslie”), who was a complainant before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (“the Commission”), by an application filed on 4 January 2001 commenced a proceeding under subs [83A(1)](https://jade.io/article/219680/section/15259) of the _[Sex Discrimination Act 1984](https://jade.io/article/219680)_ [(Cth)](https://jade.io/article/219680) (“the [SDA](https://jade.io/article/219680)”) in the Court for an order to enforce a determination of the Commission made under subs [81(1)](https://jade.io/article/219680/section/4325) of the [SDA](https://jade.io/article/219680). Although subs [83A(1)](https://jade.io/article/219680/section/15259) of the [SDA](https://jade.io/article/219680) was repealed by s [101](https://jade.io/article/226773/section/921) of the _[Human Rights Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 1999](https://jade.io/article/226773)_ [(Cth)](https://jade.io/article/226773), s [8(e)](https://jade.io/article/226773/section/11831) of the _[Acts Interpretation Act 1901](https://jade.io/article/219526)_ [(Cth)](https://jade.io/article/219526) preserves its operation in relation to the maintenance of the proceedings.
    
2. On 10 November 1997 Ms Leslie lodged with the Commission a complaint in writing alleging that the first respondent (“Mr Lincoln Graham”) and the second respondent (“Roger Graham & Associates”) by its directors Mr Roger Graham and Mrs Margaret Graham (“Mrs Graham”), had, in effect, done acts that were unlawful by virtue of provisions of Part II of the [SDA](https://jade.io/article/219680) (see subs [50(1)](https://jade.io/article/219680/section/3532) of the [SDA](https://jade.io/article/219680)). By her complaint ==Ms Leslie alleged that Mr Lincoln Graham, one of her fellow employees at Roger Graham & Associates, on 16 November 1996 subjected her to sexual harassment and that Roger Graham & Associates had thereafter unfairly terminated her employment because of the alleged sexual harassment.==
    
3. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) inquired into the subject matter of Ms Leslie’s complaint and on 25 January 1999 referred the complaint to the Commission on the basis that her endeavour to settle the matter by conciliation had not been successful (see s [57](https://jade.io/article/219680/section/582) of the [SDA](https://jade.io/article/219680)).
    
4. On 13 March 2000 Mr Graeme Innes AM, Inquiry Commissioner (“the Inquiry Commissioner”), held an inquiry into Ms Leslie’s complaint (see Division 3 of Part III of the [SDA](https://jade.io/article/219680)). Neither of the respondents exercised his or its right of appearance at the inquiry (see s [65](https://jade.io/article/219680/section/1362) of the [SDA](https://jade.io/article/219680)). On 13 March 2000 the Inquiry Commissioner deliver _ex tempore_ reasons for concluding that Mr Lincoln Graham and Roger Graham & Associates had engaged in unlawful discrimination and harassment under the [SDA](https://jade.io/article/219680). The written reasons for decision of the Inquiry Commissioner, which were published on 21 July 2000, record the following conclusion:
    
    > _“I direct that the amount of $18,000 is payable to the complainant jointly and severally by both respondents following my decision that they are liable for a breach of the Act in terms of sexual harassment of the complainant on or before 28 days from the publication of written reasons for this decision._
    > 
    > _I further direct that the amount of $7,000 is payable by the company for its liability in the area of victimisation on or before 28 days from the publication of reasons for this decision._
    > 
    > _Finally, I direct that the company provide the complainant with a written statement confirming that the termination of her employment was not related to any decrease in her work performance on or before 28 days from the publication of reasons for this decision.”_
    
5. The determination of the Inquiry Commissioner was not binding on the parties to the determination (subs 81(2)) of the [SDA](https://jade.io/article/219680)). Despite being requested by Mr Leslie’s solicitors to do so, neither of the respondents complied with the determination of the Inquiry Commissioner.
