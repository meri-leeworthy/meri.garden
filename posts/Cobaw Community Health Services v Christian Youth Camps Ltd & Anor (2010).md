- Complaint that Christian adventure resort refused to take booking for youth group based on sexual orientation of attendees.
- The WayOut project is a state-wide youth suicide prevention project targeting same sex attracted young people in rural areas, managed by Cobaw Community Health Services: [5], [8]
- Ms Hackney called the adventure resort and spoke to Mr Rowe to make a  booking. What was actually said in the conversation is in dispute, but what  is clear is that, when she reflected on the call, Ms Hackney considered Mr  Rowe had refused to take her booking, and had done so because of the  sexual orientation of the proposed attendees: [6]
- A complaint of discrimination was made to the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commissioner pursuant to s 104 of the _Equal Opportunity_ _Act_ _1995_ (Vic) (EO Act) which was referred to VCAT: [7]

- The complaint concerned: (a) refusal to provide services, (b) subjecting the applicant to detriment in the provision of services and (c) refusing or failing to accept an application for accommodation – on the basis “the proposed attendees were discriminated against on the basis of their (same sex) sexual orientation, or their personal association with persons identified by their (same sex) sexual orientation”: [8]
- Complainant sought declaration of discrimination and compensation of  $5,000 for hurt/distress: [358] which was subsequently ordered: [360]-[361]

- Hampel J found no expert evidence is needed where the discrimination  relates to sexual orientation and when the discriminatory conduct is  directed at a group supporting homosexuality in light of the objects of the  EO Act: [47]
- Note that the Supreme Court of Appeal confirmed discrimination based on sexual orientation. High Court refused special leave to appeal against this decision.
