To factor a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, follow these steps:

### 1. Check if the Quadratic is Factorable

First, determine if the quadratic can be factored over the integers by calculating the discriminant ($b^2 - 4ac$). If the discriminant is a perfect square, then the quadratic can be factored over the integers.

### 2. Factorisation by Splitting the Middle Term

For a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c$, follow these steps to factor it by splitting the middle term:

1. **Multiply $a$ and $c$**: Multiply the coefficient of $x^2$ (which is $a$) and the constant term (which is $c$).

2. **Find Two Numbers that Multiply to $ac$ and Add to $b$**: Identify two numbers $m$ and $n$ such that $m \times n = ac$ and $m + n = b$.

3. **Rewrite the Middle Term**: Rewrite the quadratic equation, splitting the middle term $bx$ into two terms using the numbers $m$ and $n$.

4. **Factor by Grouping**: Group the terms into two pairs and factor out the common factors from each pair.

5. **Factor Out the Common Binomial Factor**: Factor out the common binomial factor to get the factored form.

### Example

Let's factor the quadratic equation $2x^2 + 5x + 3$.

1. **Multiply $a$ and $c$**:
   $$
   a = 2, \quad b = 5, \quad c = 3
   $$
   $$
   ac = 2 \times 3 = 6
   $$

2. **Find Two Numbers**:
   We need two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 5. The numbers are 2 and 3:
   $$
   m = 2, \quad n = 3
   $$

3. **Rewrite the Middle Term**:
   Rewrite $5x$ as $2x + 3x$:
   $$
   2x^2 + 2x + 3x + 3
   $$

4. **Factor by Grouping**:
   Group the terms and factor out the common factors from each pair:
   $$
   2x(x + 1) + 3(x + 1)
   $$

5. **Factor Out the Common Binomial Factor**:
   Factor out $(x + 1)$:
   $$
   (2x + 3)(x + 1)
   $$

Therefore, the quadratic equation $2x^2 + 5x + 3$ factors to $(2x + 3)(x + 1)$.

To factor a cubic polynomial with only a first term and a constant, such as $ax^3 + b$, you can follow these steps:

### Example: Factor $2x^3 - 16$

1. **Identify the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**:
   First, identify any common factors between the terms. In this case, the GCF of $2x^3$ and $-16$ is $2$.

   $$
   2x^3 - 16 = 2(x^3 - 8)
   $$

2. **Recognize the Difference of Cubes**:
   The expression inside the parentheses, $x^3 - 8$, is a difference of cubes. The difference of cubes can be factored using the formula:

   $$
   a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)
   $$

   Here, $a = x$ and $b = 2$ because $8 = 2^3$.

3. **Apply the Difference of Cubes Formula**:
   Substitute $a = x$ and $b = 2$ into the formula:

   $$
   x^3 - 2^3 = (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 4)
   $$

4. **Combine with the GCF**:
   Now, combine this result with the GCF factored out earlier:

   $$
   2(x^3 - 8) = 2(x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 4)
   $$

Therefore, the factored form of $2x^3 - 16$ is:

$$
2(x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 4)
$$

### Steps for Factoring a General Cubic Polynomial $ax^3 + b$:

1. **Factor out the GCF**:
   $$
   ax^3 + b = a(x^3 + \frac{b}{a})
   $$

2. **Recognize the Difference of Cubes**:
   Rewrite the expression inside the parentheses as a difference of cubes if possible:
   $$
   x^3 + \frac{b}{a} = x^3 - (-\frac{b}{a})
   $$

3. **Apply the Difference of Cubes Formula**:
   $$
   x^3 - (-\frac{b}{a}) = (x - \sqrt[3]{-\frac{b}{a}})(x^2 + x\sqrt[3]{-\frac{b}{a}} + (\sqrt[3]{-\frac{b}{a}})^2)
   $$

4. **Combine with the GCF**:
   Multiply the factored form by the GCF to get the final factored polynomial.
