- A nightclub was found to have discriminated against the complainant, a  music promoter of African origin, when it cancelled his booking at the  venue for an African music themed event. 
- The nightclub had cancelled the event after it learned the event was to be  titled 'Africa Fest'. It claimed this meant the nightclub would have to  engage additional security to comply with local guidelines for 'culturally  specific' events. VCAT rejected this argument and found there was no legal requirement to comply with the guidelines.

Mr Obudho sought compensation of $8,000 for economic loss in the form of lost profits on the proposed Africa Fest.



- VCAT issued a declaration of discrimination, but did not award any  damages to Mr Obudho because the nightclub had not discriminated against him as the organiser.
- **However**, the Supreme Court, applying the ordinary dictionary meaning to the phrase, found Mr Obudho, was 'a victim of the discriminatory conduct constituted by the cancellation of the booking for the Africa Fest' and was 'entitled to compensation directed to putting him in the position that he would have been in had the booking for the Africa Fest not been cancelled': at [37].
- It did not matter whether he suffered loss as an event organiser or as a patron - what mattered was that he suffered loss was suffered 'in consequence of' the nightclub's breach of the Act. For this reason, Mr Obudho was entitled to compensation for his loss of profit on the Africa  Fest. He was also entitled to compensation of $6000 for non-economic loss in the form of personal upset and humiliation: at [51].


37. On that basis, Mr Obudho, as a victim of the discriminatory conduct constituted by the cancellation of the booking for the Africa Fest, is entitled to compensation directed to putting him in the position that he would have been in had the booking for the Africa Fest not been cancelled.  He is entitled to compensation for his loss of profit on the Africa Fest.
    

38. The Tribunal was required to consider whether the loss suffered by Mr Obudho was ‘in consequence of’ the cancellation of the booking for the Africa Fest. The Tribunal, in focussing on the capacity in which Mr Obudho had been discriminated against, failed to ask whether Mr Obudho had suffered loss in consequence of the contravention of the [EO Act](https://jade.io/article/281882), that is, as a result of the cancellation of the booking for the Africa Fest.
    

39. Ground 1 is made out.


(47) There was evidence before the Tribunal about Mr Obudho’s loss of profit upon which the Court can act.  That evidence is in the transcript.  Mr Obudho gave evidence that, had the event not been cancelled by Patty Malones, he was expecting to make a profit of around $6,000 to $7,000; Ms Steponavicius gave evidence that the expected profit from the event was in the range of $7,000 to $8,000, based on an expectation of 250 to 400 attendees, with a ticket price of $25.
    

(48) It was submitted that the figures put forward by Mr Obudho and Ms Steponavicius were gross figures that needed to be adjusted for the costs that would have been incurred in putting on the Africa Fest.  The evidence in this regard was somewhat confusing.  Counsel for Mr Obudho described it as ‘ambiguous’.  It is not clear whether the costs of staging the Africa Fest have been deducted from the amounts claimed.  As a result, I intend to accept the lowest of the figures put forward by Mr Obudho for his loss of profit.  I will order the payment of compensation for Mr Obudho’s loss of profit on the cancelled event in the amount of $6,000.


(51) Having regard to recent awards made by the Tribunal for non-economic loss[[31]](https://jade.io/#_ftn31) and the (rather scant) direct evidence supporting this claim, I consider that Mr Obudho should be awarded $6,000 for non-economic loss in the form of personal upset and humiliation.
