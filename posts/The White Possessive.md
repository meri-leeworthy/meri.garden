## Property, Power, and Indigenous Sovereignty


> [!NOTE] GPT Note
Moreton-Robinsonâ€™s work touches on both [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]], especially in her book _"The White Possessive."_ She interrogates Western ontologies of property and whiteness, contrasting them with Indigenous ontologies rooted in connection to Country. In her earlier work _"Talkin' Up to the White Woman"_ (2000), she critiques the limitations of feminist epistemologies that centre whiteness, while advocating for Indigenous feminist knowledge systems based on kinship, land, and spiritual relationships.
