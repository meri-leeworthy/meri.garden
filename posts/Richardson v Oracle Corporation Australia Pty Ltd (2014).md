**HUMAN RIGHTS** – discrimination – causation – whether sufficient causal nexus between sexual harassment and the effects of workplace investigation – whether sufficient causal nexus between sexual harassment and alleged psychological injury suffered as a result of complaint to AHRC and subsequent litigation – whether “false denials” of sexual harasser provided causal link between unlawful conduct and harm suffered rebutting denials in various fora – causation not made out.

**HUMAN RIGHTS** – discrimination – causation – whether appellant left employment ‘voluntarily’ – whether appellant demoted by employer - whether sufficient causal nexus between sexual harassment and decision by appellant to leave workplace – whether analysis of causation in _[Medlin v State Government Insurance Commission](https://jade.io/article/67919)_ (1995) 182 CLR 1 applied to decision by appellant to leave employment – _[Medlin](https://jade.io/article/67919)_ applied –  causation made out.

**HUMAN RIGHTS** – discrimination – indirect discrimination – whether higher prevalence of women as sexual harassment complainants rendered workplace policy imposed on complainants generally as one “disadvantaging persons of the same sex as the aggrieved person” – proper starting point for analysis of indirect discrimination discussed – indirect discrimination not made out.

**DAMAGES** – assessment of general damages – whether trial judge assessed statutory damages under s [46PO(4)(d)](https://jade.io/article/218280/section/34856) of the _[Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986](https://jade.io/article/218280)_ [(Cth)](https://jade.io/article/218280) by applying tortious principles – whether damages pursuant to [AHRC Act](https://jade.io/article/218280) can be awarded to partially compensate for loss - proper approach to assessment of damages under s [46PO(4)(d)](https://jade.io/article/218280/section/34856) discussed.

**DAMAGES –** assessment of general damages – whether trial judge assessed appellant’s injuries solely by reference to ability to work – whether trial judge assessed general damages by reference to nature of sexual harassment – no error disclosed in trial judgment.

**DAMAGES** – assessment of general damages – damages for diminished sexual relationship as a result of sexual harassment – decline of relationship discussed by trial judge with reference to a “variety of factors” always operating in a relationship – finding of trial judge overturned - approach to damages and causation where multiple factors potentially at large in recognised loss discussed – damages awarded for diminished sexual relationship.

**DAMAGES –** assessment of general damages – whether award of damages manifestly inadequate – damages awarded pursuant to s [46PO(4)(d)](https://jade.io/article/218280/section/34856) fundamentally compensatory in nature – nature of damages for sexual discrimination and sexual harassment discussed - damages manifestly inadequate.

**DAMAGES –** assessment of economic damages – whether trial judge erred in method for calculation of damages – recovery of damages for foregone chance or opportunity - calculating base salary and damages where projected earnings and promotion prospects are uncertain – assessing entitlement to discretionary bonuses – standard of proof - need to assess the circumstances of past occurrences to assess their utility as a predictive tool – challenge to calculation not made out.
