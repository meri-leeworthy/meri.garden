- Neville FM found that decision of a community radio station to refuse the  membership applications of two Aboriginal women was racially  discriminatory.
- The court ordered the radio station to accept the membership applications. While Neville FM accepted that ‘the failure to provide medical evidence is  not fatal to any claim for general damages’, his Honour said it militated  against a large award: [124].
- There was also no evidence the actions of the radio station had impaired  the employment of the applicants.
- Damages of $6000 were awarded to each applicant. Costs were also  awarded against the radio station.
