Practising Commoning
https://commonslibrary.org/practising-commoning/

>"Commoning, as an activity of caring for and communicating with a living world is a practice of attending to and exploring the possibilities of such an ecology of life, of creatively exploring other ways of being, thinking and doing."
>[[Fields of Commoning]]


>Those who piece together collective forms of creating and exchanging do so in order to meet concrete needs, and in doing so they confront concrete dynamics of power as they encounter both private (market) and public forces. The tensions thus generated, and the way in which the urban commons does or does not deal with them, can help understand the pitfalls and possibilities of ‘commoning’ as a material practice. – [Michael Bresnihan and Michael Byrne 2015](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/297035860.pdf).

>The common is not to be construed, therefore, as a particular kind of thing, asset or even social process, but as an unstable and malleable social relation between a particular self-defined social group and those aspects of its actually existing or yet-to-be-created social and/or physical environment deemed crucial to its life and livelihood. There is, in effect, a social practice of commoning. – [David Harvey 2012](https://www.worldcat.org/title/767564397)
