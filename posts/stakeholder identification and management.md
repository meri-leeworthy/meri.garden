### 1. Stakeholder identification and management

Stakeholder identification and management is a critical aspect of project management and business processes. It involves identifying, understanding, and effectively engaging with individuals, groups, or organisations that have a vested interest or stake in a project, initiative, or the outcomes of an organisation. These stakeholders can influence or be influenced by the project or organisation, and their needs, expectations, and concerns should be considered and managed to ensure project success and stakeholder satisfaction. The following are key components of stakeholder identification and management.

- #### Identification
	The first step is to identify all relevant stakeholders. This involves systematically identifying individuals, groups, or organisations that may be impacted by or have an impact on the project or initiative. Stakeholders can include customers, employees, suppliers, regulatory bodies, shareholders, competitors, and the general public.
- #### Categorisation
	Once stakeholders are identified, they are often categorised into different groups based on their level of influence, interest, or involvement in the project. Common categorisations include primary stakeholders (those directly affected by the project), secondary stakeholders (indirectly affected), and external stakeholders (those outside of the organisation).
- #### Understanding
	It is essential to gain a deep understanding of each stakeholder's interests, needs, expectations, and concerns. This involves communication and engagement with stakeholders to gather information and insights about their perspectives.
- #### Engagement and communication
	Effective communication is vital for managing stakeholders. Project managers and teams should establish clear lines of communication with stakeholders, tailoring messages and engagement strategies to suit each group's characteristics and preferences.

Effective stakeholder identification and management are crucial for project success, as it helps build support, mitigate risks, and ensure that projects align with the expectations and interests of key stakeholders. It is a fundamental component of project management and business strategy, ensuring that projects and initiatives are carried out with the support and cooperation of all relevant parties.

### 2. An example case study

##### Case study: Stakeholder identification for a Learning Management System implementation

**Background:** Monash University is a large, prestigious university that is planning to implement a new Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) to enhance the teaching and learning experience for students and faculty. The university's decision to adopt the LMS is driven by the need for a more robust and integrated platform that can support online courses, blended learning, and administrative functions. Stakeholder identification and management are crucial to ensure the successful implementation of the LMS.

Following the first step of requirement engineering (stakeholder identification), the following stakeholders are identified:

1. _Faculty Members:_ Faculty members are a primary stakeholder group. They will use the LMS for course delivery, content creation, and student management. Identifying influential faculty members and gathering their input is critical.
2. _Students:_ Students are key stakeholders as they will be the end-users of the LMS. Their input on usability, accessibility, and their learning experience is vital.
3. _IT Department (Monash eSolutions):_ The university's IT department is responsible for implementing and maintaining the LMS. Their expertise is essential for a successful rollout.
4. _Administrative Staff (Monash Connect):_ Administrative staff, including registrars, admission officers, and academic advisors, will use the LMS for various administrative functions. Their needs and requirements must be considered.
5. _LMS Vendors (the Moodle development team):_ The LMS vendor or vendors are stakeholders because their product needs to align with the university's requirements.

Stakeholder identification and management in this LMS implementation are crucial to address the diverse needs and expectations of the university's various stakeholders, ensuring a successful rollout and adoption of the new system. Effective engagement with these stakeholders will lead to a more responsive and user-friendly LMS that meets the university's educational goals.
