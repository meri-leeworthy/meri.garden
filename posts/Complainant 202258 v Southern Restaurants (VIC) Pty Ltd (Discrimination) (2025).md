> **REASONS FOR DECISION**

1. This decision follows findings and Orders issued by this Tribunal on 23 September 2023,[[1]](https://jade.io/#_ftn1) consequent upon an application alleging unlawful discrimination under the _[Discrimination Act 1991](https://jade.io/article/402954)_ (**[Discrimination Act](https://jade.io/article/402954)**). The Tribunal found that the respondent had discriminated against the applicant by imposing upon her a condition of employment, being that she remains on the premises at all times during her shift, including during unpaid breaks, unreasonably disadvantaged her in contravention of Part [3](https://jade.io/article/402954/section/436) of the [Discrimination Act](https://jade.io/article/402954) because she was breastfeeding.
