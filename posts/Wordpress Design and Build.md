I was asked to complete a website redesign for an osteopathy clinic after the previous contractor had to quit the project. I received a short design brief and the half-finished site which was built using Wordpress and Elementor page builder, tools I had little to no experience using. I completed the redesign promptly and received the following feedback:

_"Meri has been a dream to work with! Clear, prompt and honest communication, with good advice when dealing with our business that knows nothing about websites. We asked Meri to jump in on a half finished project toward the end of the year no less and she took it all onboard easily and quickly. Thanks so much for your help Meri, highly recommend!"_ - Carmen Marom, Sound Osteopathy

The completed website can be viewed here:
