money -> commodity -> money
[[The General Formula for Capital]]:
"where money is transformed into a commodity and reverse-transformed from a commodity into money"
"buying in order to sell"
"money’s circulation as capital"

"Money that moves through the second circuit is transformed into capital, becomes capital, and, in terms of its purpose, already is capital"

"Anyone can see that the M-C-M circulation process would be absurd and pointless as a roundabout way to exchange an amount of money value for the same amount: for example, £100 for £100. Much ==simpler and more secure== would be what the person who amasses money does. He doesn’t expose his £100 to the dangers of circulation; he just holds onto his money"

contrast with [[C-M-C]]

## My notes
M-C-M is essentially [[investment]], the more general form of [[finance]]. Buying in order to sell in capitalism is a venture all about making profit.
