## Member L Johnson .

[1]  These reasons are concerned only with the assessment of detriment and of damages in respect of my earlier findings in relation to the claims made by Sudesh Kumari that she had been subjected to sexual harassment, and discrimination on the grounds of race and victimised, within the meaning of the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Vic) (EO Act). For reasons which are explained in my earlier written reasons (earlier decision),[1](https://plus.lexis.com/apac/document/?pdmfid=1539278&crid=ac581b6e-b39e-458e-a94e-4fe373688ec3&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases-au%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A687J-6R41-JNS1-M1VT-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=267716&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&prid=967fa060-8ea9-4af3-b291-f84472c715af&ecomp=s85k&earg=sr29#) I gave written reasons in relation to my findings in respect of those claims but reserved my decision on detriment and the assessment of damages.

[2]  In the earlier decision I made six findings of contravention of the EO Act by Della Rosa:

- i. A fellow employee engaged in sexual harassment of Ms Kumari contrary to section 93 of the EO Act, when he looked at her breasts rather than her face when he spoke to her;[2](https://plus.lexis.com/apac/document/?pdmfid=1539278&crid=ac581b6e-b39e-458e-a94e-4fe373688ec3&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases-au%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A687J-6R41-JNS1-M1VT-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=267716&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&prid=967fa060-8ea9-4af3-b291-f84472c715af&ecomp=s85k&earg=sr29#)
- ii. Ms Kumari’s immediate manager, Mr Gonzales, treated Ms Kumari unfavourably due to her race when he said to her ‘you are Indian, I don’t like Indians, they always cause problems’;[3](https://plus.lexis.com/apac/document/?pdmfid=1539278&crid=ac581b6e-b39e-458e-a94e-4fe373688ec3&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases-au%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A687J-6R41-JNS1-M1VT-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=267716&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&prid=967fa060-8ea9-4af3-b291-f84472c715af&ecomp=s85k&earg=sr29#)
- iii. Ms Kumari’s manager, and the director of Della Rosa, Mr de Lorso, directly discriminated against Ms Kumari because they treated Ms Kumari unfavourably due to her sex in their investigation of her complaint about the sexual harassment;[4](https://plus.lexis.com/apac/document/?pdmfid=1539278&crid=ac581b6e-b39e-458e-a94e-4fe373688ec3&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases-au%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A687J-6R41-JNS1-M1VT-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=267716&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&prid=967fa060-8ea9-4af3-b291-f84472c715af&ecomp=s85k&earg=sr29#)
- iv. Della Rosa victimised Ms Kumari in directing her to take annual leave from 14 August 2017 to 18 August 2017 because that direction was made for the reason that Ms Kumari had made a complaint about sexual harassment;[5](https://plus.lexis.com/apac/document/?pdmfid=1539278&crid=ac581b6e-b39e-458e-a94e-4fe373688ec3&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases-au%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A687J-6R41-JNS1-M1VT-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=267716&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&prid=967fa060-8ea9-4af3-b291-f84472c715af&ecomp=s85k&earg=sr29#)
- v. Della Rosa’s decision to transfer Ms Kumari to a different workplace amounted to unfavourable treatment due to Ms Kumari’s sex, and because she had made a complaint;[6](https://plus.lexis.com/apac/document/?pdmfid=1539278&crid=ac581b6e-b39e-458e-a94e-4fe373688ec3&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases-au%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A687J-6R41-JNS1-M1VT-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=267716&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&prid=967fa060-8ea9-4af3-b291-f84472c715af&ecomp=s85k&earg=sr29#) and
- vi. Della Rosa treated Ms Kumari unfavourably by not informing Ms Kumari of her transfer to the different workplace until 5.30 am on the morning of her return to work, and that treatment was because of Ms Kumari’s sex and race.[7](https://plus.lexis.com/apac/document/?pdmfid=1539278&crid=ac581b6e-b39e-458e-a94e-4fe373688ec3&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases-au%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A687J-6R41-JNS1-M1VT-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=267716&pdislpamode=false&pdworkfolderlocatorid=NOT_SAVED_IN_WORKFOLDER&prid=967fa060-8ea9-4af3-b291-f84472c715af&ecomp=s85k&earg=sr29#)

[3]  I made orders for the parties to file and serve their submissions on the question of detriment.

[4]  After the hearing had concluded, orders were made, extending again the compliance dates for filing the parties’ submissions on detriment. Those compliance dates were further extended a number of times, due to Covid lockdowns and other factors.

[5]  Completion of these written reasons has been delayed by other pressures within the Tribunal. I apologise to the parties for the delay.

[6]  The findings I made in the earlier decision were findings of contravention of provisions of Part 4, Part 6 and Part 7 of the EO Act. Section 125 of the EO Act sets out the orders the Tribunal may make if the Tribunal finds that a person has contravened a provision of Part 4, 6 or 7 of the EO Act. The orders the Tribunal may make include an order that the person found to have contravened one of those provisions pay the applicant an amount the Tribunal thinks fit to compensate the applicant for loss, damage or injury suffered in consequence of the contravention.

[7]  Ms Kumari has claimed $62,000 for non-economic loss, and $121,021.75 for economic loss. Della Rosa submitted that no more than $12,500 should be awarded for non-economic loss, and that no award should be made in relation to the claim for economic loss.

[8]  For the reasons set out here, I have determined to award Ms Kumari $38,000.00 in compensation for non-economic loss in respect of Della Rosa’s contravention of the EO Act in its conduct toward her, and
