**REASONS**

**INTRODUCTION**

1. This is an application by Ms Jae Suk Hwang alleging discrimination against the respondent, the Business Licensing Authority (‘**BLA**’). In correspondence sent on 23 February, 14 June and 27 July 2022, Ms Hwang requested a partial refund of her brothel manager application fee from the BLA, which was refused.
    
2. The brief factual background is that in 2020 and 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, brothels were closed in Victoria for a total of 262 days due to orders made by the State Government under the ‘State of Emergency’ first declared on 16 March 2020.[[1]](https://jade.io/#_ftn1)  The BLA gave refunds of brothel licensing fees to brothel licensees, but not of application fees to brothel managers. This different treatment between brothel managers and brothel licensees is the basis of this discrimination claim.
    
    ---
    
    [[1]](https://jade.io/#_ftnref1)          This total of 262 days is taken from correspondence between the applicant and the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission, which was annexed to the original application filed with the Tribunal on 6 February 2023. There were varying accounts of the number of days brothels were shut down and the applicant was unable to work. It was not in issue however that there were a substantial number of days during 2020 and 2021 in which brothels were closed and the applicant was unable to work as a brothel manager.
    
    ---
    
3. The BLA is an independent statutory authority which, at the relevant time, administered the licensing of sex work services under the _[Sex Work Act 1994](https://jade.io/article/282472)_ [(Vic)](https://jade.io/article/282472) (‘**[Sex Work Act](https://jade.io/article/282472)**’).[[2]](https://jade.io/#_ftn2) Sex work service providers must be approved and licensed (brothel licensees), and proposed managers of licensed brothels must apply to and be approved by the BLA. If approved, brothel licensees pay a one-off application fee and an annual licence fee. Applicants seeking to be approved as a brothel manager are required to pay an application fee which, if approved, is paid every third year at a cost, at the time Ms Hwang made payment, of $511.00. This works out at $170.33 per year.

    [[2]](https://jade.io/#_ftnref2)          The _[Sex Work Act 1994](https://jade.io/article/282472)_ [(Vic)](https://jade.io/article/282472) was repealed on 1 December 2023 by section [37](https://jade.io/article/932663/section/460) of the _[Sex Work Decriminalisation Act 2022](https://jade.io/article/932663)_ [(Vic)](https://jade.io/article/932663).
    
    ---
    
4. On 16 June 2020 the Registrar of the BLA was given discretionary powers under regulation 13A of the _[Sex Work (Fees) Regulations 2014](https://jade.io/article/338085)_ [(Vic)](https://jade.io/article/338085)[[3]](https://jade.io/#_ftn3) (‘**the Regulations**') to refund any fee paid under the [Sex Work Act](https://jade.io/article/282472) if there are exceptional circumstances in relation to a licensee or approved manager, and the refund is appropriate because of the exceptional circumstances.

    ---
    
5. Firstly, Ms Hwang claims direct discrimination by the BLA on the basis of the attribute of her profession, trade or occupation,[[4]](https://jade.io/#_ftn4) namely brothel manager, for not giving her a refund of her brothel manager application fee.
    
    ---
    
    [[4]](https://jade.io/#_ftnref4)          Under section [6(la)](https://jade.io/article/281882/section/1391911) of the _[Equal Opportunity Act 2010](https://jade.io/article/281882)_ [(Vic)](https://jade.io/article/281882) (‘**[Equal Opportunity Act](https://jade.io/article/281882)**’) this is an attribute on the basis of which discrimination is prohibited in the areas of activity as set out in the [Equal Opportunity Act](https://jade.io/article/281882).
    
    ---
    
6. Secondly, Ms Hwang claims the BLA indirectly discriminated against her by imposing an unreasonable requirement that disadvantaged her.
    
7. The Applicant claims:
    
    > ‘A. A declaration that the Respondent has unlawfully discriminated against the Applicant in contravention of s [44(1)(a)](https://jade.io/article/281882/section/7180) of the Act.
    > 
    > B. An order that the Respondent refrain from committing any further contravention of the Act by refusing to provide fee relief and in fact provide fee relief.
    > 
    > C. Compensation for hurt and humiliation.
    > 
    > D. Costs as still ongoing are to be advised.
    > 
    > E. Any other order that the Tribunal sees fit.’[[5]](https://jade.io/#_ftn5)

8. The applicant makes her application to the Tribunal’s original jurisdiction pursuant to sections [122](https://jade.io/article/281882/section/2461) and [123(1)(a)](https://jade.io/article/281882/section/20862) of the _[Equal Opportunity Act](https://jade.io/article/281882) (2010)_ (Vic) (‘**Equal Opportunity Act**’).
    
9. The respondent submitted Ms Hwang’s claim must fail for three reasons.[[6]](https://jade.io/#_ftn6)
    
    ---
    
    [[6]](https://jade.io/#_ftnref6)          These were expanded in final submissions and are detailed at [57] – [71].
    
    ---
    
10. Firstly, the respondent denies it directly discriminated against Ms Hwang on the basis of her profession, trade or occupation as the respondent’s decision not to extend fee relief was based on the nature and characteristics of the fee paid, namely that it was an application fee.
    
11. Secondly, whilst admitting the position of brothel manager is an attribute for the purposes of the [Equal Opportunity Act](https://jade.io/article/281882), namely a profession, trade or occupation, it was not an attribute when Ms Hwang made her original application on 23 February 2022. The amendment inserting section [6(la)](https://jade.io/article/281882/section/1391911) in the [Equal Opportunity Act](https://jade.io/article/281882) came into effect on 10 May 2022.
    
12. Thirdly, the decision of the BLA not to grant fee relief was not a _service_ as the respondent was performing a statutory duty requiring the exercise of discretion.
