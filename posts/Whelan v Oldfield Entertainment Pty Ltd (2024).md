> 
> **RAPER J:**

1. The respondent (**Oldfield Entertainment)** seeks the summary resolution of a number of aspects of the applicant, **Ms Whelan**’s claim by use of two procedural vehicles, strike out and summary judgment. By way of interlocutory application dated 9 November 2023, Oldfield Entertainment seeks orders that certain paragraphs of the statement of claim (**SOC**) filed by Ms Whelan be struck out pursuant to rr [16.21(e)](https://jade.io/article/251316/section/371353) and/or (d) of the _[Federal Court](https://jade.io/article/251316) **[Rules](https://jade.io/article/251316)** [2011](https://jade.io/article/251316)_ [(Cth)](https://jade.io/article/251316) or, alternatively, that certain claims contained within the impugned paragraphs be summarily dismissed pursuant to s [31A](https://jade.io/article/218757/section/5241) of the **_[F](https://jade.io/article/218757)_**_[ederal](https://jade.io/article/218757) **[C](https://jade.io/article/218757)**[ourt of](https://jade.io/article/218757) **[A](https://jade.io/article/218757)**[ustralia](https://jade.io/article/218757) **[Act](https://jade.io/article/218757)** [1976](https://jade.io/article/218757)_ [(Cth)](https://jade.io/article/218757) and r [26.01(a)](https://jade.io/article/251316/section/204414) and (c) of the Rules.
    
2. An application for strike out is concerned only with the adequacy of the pleaded causes of action. The rule does not permit or allow for consideration of facts or evidence outside of the pleading. By contrast, an application for summary judgment requires consideration of matters outside of the pleading. In this case, the issue is whether Ms Whelan has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting those parts of the proceeding to which the impugned paragraphs of the SOC relate or no reasonable cause of action is disclosed.
    
3. Oldfield Entertainment submits that the following paragraphs of the SOC do not disclose a reasonable cause of action for the following reasons:
    
    > (a)          paragraph [134] of the SOC (as well as paragraphs [101]–[133]) does not disclose a reasonable cause of action for victimisation under ss [94(2)](https://jade.io/article/219680/section/8990) or [47A(2)](https://jade.io/article/219680/section/9526) of the **_[S](https://jade.io/article/219680)_**_[ex](https://jade.io/article/219680) **[D](https://jade.io/article/219680)**[iscrimination](https://jade.io/article/219680) **[Act](https://jade.io/article/219680)** [1984](https://jade.io/article/219680)_ [(Cth)](https://jade.io/article/219680), nor do paragraphs [101]–[133] constitute grounds for awarding aggravated damages;
    > 
    > (b)          paragraph [163] of the SOC does not disclose a reasonable cause of action for damages because the events relied upon are submitted to be too remote to be properly or reasonably attributed to Oldfield Entertainment’s purportedly unlawful conduct; and
    > 
    > (c)          paragraphs [57], [92] and [133] of the SOC fall outside the jurisdiction of the Court pursuant to s [46PO(3)](https://jade.io/article/218280/section/699) of the **_[A](https://jade.io/article/218280)_**_[ustralian](https://jade.io/article/218280) **[H](https://jade.io/article/218280)**[uman](https://jade.io/article/218280) **[R](https://jade.io/article/218280)**[ights](https://jade.io/article/218280) **[C](https://jade.io/article/218280)**[ommission](https://jade.io/article/218280) **[Act](https://jade.io/article/218280)** [1986](https://jade.io/article/218280)_ [(Cth)](https://jade.io/article/218280) because those matters did not form part of the complaint made to the **[A](https://jade.io/article/150883)**ustralian **H**uman **R**ights **C**ommission.
    
4. For the following reasons, I dismiss the application for summary judgment but will allow the application for strike out in part and will also allow Ms Whelan to re-plead that paragraph which has been struck out concerning her victimisation claim and to re-craft her claim to address the deficiencies identified in these reasons.
    
    **Background**
    
5. Ms Whelan is an actress, singer and performer who was employed by Oldfield Entertainment between 29 November 2013 and 13 July 2014 to perform the role of “Janet” in Oldfield Entertainment’s production of _The Rocky Horror Show_ (**2014 show**). Mr Craig McLachlan was employed by Oldfield Entertainment to play the lead role of ‘Frank-n-Furter’ in the 2014 show.
    
6. During the 2014 show, Ms Whelan claims that Mr McLachlan inappropriately kissed her, touched her and used sexualised language to refer to other female employees involved in the 2014 show.
    
7. Ms Whelan claims that she has been subjected to the following three forms of unlawful discrimination under the SD Act: sex discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation.
    
8. It is worthwhile also referring to the procedural history of this matter. Pursuant to orders made by the Court on 22 September 2023, Oldfield Entertainment was required to file and serve its defence by 10 November 2023. The day before it was required to do so, Oldfield Entertainment filed this interlocutory application. Under the same order, the matter was referred to Court-ordered mediation. Oldfield Entertainment has not filed any defence as yet. I echo the concerns of White J in _[Hillig v Darkinjung Pty Ltd & Ors](https://jade.io/article/11863)_ [2007] NSWSC 683 at [[35]–[36]](https://jade.io/article/11863/section/3351):
    
    > [35]         ...The time for making any such complaint about lack of particularity would be once defences have been filed and affidavits have been served, and only then, if it could seriously be contended that the defendants did not understand the case they have to meet.
    > > 
    > [36]         Arguments about pleadings which have a tendency to delay the preparation of the case for hearing, and which are not really necessary for the defendant to understand the case against him, should be firmly discouraged.
