#### Variances

The variance of 𝑋 can be calculated directly from the following definition:

$$𝜎^2=𝐸(𝑋−μ)^2=𝑉[𝑋]$$

However, it can be calculated more easily by this equivalent formula:

$$𝑉[𝑋]=𝐸[(𝑋−𝐸[𝑋])^2]=𝐸[𝑋^2]−𝐸[𝑋]^2$$

which extends to functions

$$𝑉[𝑓(𝑋)]=𝐸[(𝑓(𝑋)−𝐸[𝑓(𝑋)])^2]$$

The alternative formula also gives the variance:

$$𝑉[𝑋]=𝐸[𝑋^2]−𝐸[𝑋]^2$$

If the variance is small, then the realisations of 𝑋 will be tightly clustered around $𝐸[𝑋]$, and if the variance is large, there are more variability values taken on by 𝑋. By the linearity of expectation, the variance has the following property:

$$𝑉[𝑐𝑋]=𝑐^2𝑉[𝑋]$$

so that the variance of 𝑋 times a constant 𝑐 is equal to the variance of 𝑋 times the square of 𝑐.
