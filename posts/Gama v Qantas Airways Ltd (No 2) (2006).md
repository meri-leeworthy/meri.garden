- Mr Gama was awarded damages to compensate him for breaches of section 9 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) and section 15(2)(d)  of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth). Mr Gama claimed damages for attendance at medical appointments, travel to medical appointments and medication costs, for the past and future.
- His Honour accepted medical evidence that the applicant experienced a  severe depressive illness and that the unlawful discrimination contributed  to that illness. Raphael FM held that remarks had been made to Mr Gama which contravened the RDA and/or the DDA, including: ‘You should be  walking up the stairs like a monkey’.
- His Honour noted that the applicant had not been able to make out the  more serious allegations in his claim and found that the discriminatory  treatment contributed 20% to his injury (special damages) - as explained at [129]-[130]:

- $1350 for 20 per cent of the cost of the doctor's appointments and $945 for 20 per cent of the cost of travel to date of hearing
- $2831 for 20 per cent of medication costs taken to date of hearing
- $3150 for 20 per cent of future doctor's appointments calculated at 15 visits per year for seven years
- $3603 for 20 per cent of future medication costs for seven years

- Interest on those amounts (taking into account Gama would have received a Medicare rebate)

- Damages upheld on appeal: _Qantas_ _Airways_ _Ltd_ _v_ _Gama_ [2008] FCAFC 69
