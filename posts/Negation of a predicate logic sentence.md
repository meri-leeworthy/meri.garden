#### 1.2. Negation of a predicate logic sentence

Negating a predicate logic sentence is more than just putting a negation symbol in front of the predicate logic sentence. It involves modifying the internal structure of the predicate logic sentence

Examples:

1. **Statement:** You are either rich or happy.  
    **Negation of this statement is**: You are not rich and not happy.  
    **Reason:** The original statement is of the form A OR B. When we want to find the negation of A or B, it will be NOT A and NOT B.
2. **Statement:** I am both rich and happy.  
    **Negation**: I am not rich, or I am not happy.  
    **Reason:** This statement is in the form of A AND B. The negation of A and B is NOT A or NOT B.
3. **Statement:** If I am rich, then I am happy.  
    **Negation**: I am rich and not happy.  
    **Reason:** If A, then B type of statements, the negation becomes A and not B.

**Take note:** When negating statements which involve 'for all', it gets replaced by 'there exists'. Similarly, when negating statements with 'there exists', it gets replaced by 'for all'.
