OpenPGP, S/MIME

Properties included [[confidentiality]] and [[authenticity]][^1]

Does not offer [[Forward secrecy]] or [[Post-compromise security]] which is a problem because 'sessions' can be very long, over years etc. This means the entire session content is vulnerable to key leaks at any point
