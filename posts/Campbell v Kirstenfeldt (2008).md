| _Campbell v_ _Kirstenfeldt_ [2008] FMCA<br><br>1356 | Federal (Lucev FM) - RDA | - Lucev FM held the applicant had been subject to six separate acts of racial hatred in breach of s 18C of the RDA.<br>- Mrs Campbell was awarded a total of $ 7,500 in damages for hurt and  humiliation. This was made up of separate damages awards for five of the six incidents.<br>- Damages were not awarded for an incident on Australia Day because a complaint made by Mrs Campbell about this incident had led to the respondent being convicted and fined and this outcome ‘must have<br><br>afforded [her] a level of “compensation” by reason of the outcome’.<br><br>- Higher awards were made in respect of incidents that occurred after the respondent’s conviction because the Court was ‘prepared to infer that greater hurt and humiliation might have been caused to Mrs Campbell in circumstances where she might expect that the conviction and fine would lead to the conduct coming to an end’.<br>- The respondent was also ordered to make a written apology. | - Total damages:<br><br>$7,500<br><br>(non- economic<br><br>)<br><br>- Apology |
