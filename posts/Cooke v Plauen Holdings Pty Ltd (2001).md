- The application failed to make out a claim of sexual harassment. However, Driver FM was satisfied that the applicant had been discriminated against  on the basis of her sex in contravention of s 14 of the SDA.
- His Honour held that although the applicant’s manager had treated all staff  badly at times, he was ‘more intrusive in his management of female staff  than in his management of male staff’: [31]. Driver FM found the respondent employer vicariously liable for the conduct of the applicant’s manager on account of the fact that the steps taken to respond to the discriminatory conduct were ‘insufficient and ineffective’: [38].
- His Honour refused the applicant’s claim for economic loss. In assessing  general damages at an amount of $750, his Honour said:”Although in  recent times there has been a tendency for damages awards for non- economic loss to increase, most of the higher awards of damages in recent  years have concerned very serious cases of sexual harassment. I have found that this is not a case of sexual harassment. The conduct complained of in this case was reprehensible in management terms but not otherwise. It was conduct that a reasonable person would have anticipated would be distressing to a young and inexperienced employee”: [42].
