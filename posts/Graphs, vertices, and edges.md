#### 1.1. Graphs, vertices, and edges

In computing, a graph is a structure consisting of points (vertices) and lines (edges) connecting vertices to form a network. Graph theory started with the Königsberg bridge problem (1735) (Sarma, 2012), which asks if the seven bridges of the city of Königsberg over the river Preger can all be traversed in a single trip without doubling back, with the additional requirement that the trip ends in the same place it began (Weisstein, 2023). Euler studied the problem of the Königsberg bridge and constructed a structure to solve the problem called the Eulerian graph (Sarma, 2012).

The following are some basic terminologies in graph theory:

- **Adjacent vertices**—two vertices that are joined by an edge.
- **Null graph**—a vertex with no edges.
- **Loop**—an edge from a vertex to the same vertex.
- **Parallel edges**—two or more edges linking the same pair of vertices.
- **Cycle**—a path in a graph with at least one edge, no repeated edges, and the first and last vertices coincide, but there are no other repeated vertices.
- **Degree**—total number of edges connected to a vertex.
- **Indegree vertices**—total number of incoming edges connected to a vertex.
- **Outdegree vertices**—total number of outgoing edges connected to a vertex.
