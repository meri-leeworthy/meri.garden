- Complaint by a mature aged graduate legal student of 14 instances of serious and sustained sexual harassment by her employer during a legal practice placement breaching EOA ss 86-7: [1]
- Proceeding anonymized
- GLS claims that she was sexually harassed (sexual comments, massage,  touching, pornographic video, sexual text messages) by PLP on a number  of occasions during her placement: [4], [20]
- In essence, Ms GLS’s case was that she was sexually harassed on a  repeated basis by Mr PLP over the period of the placement. Almost every  day, he made advances, sought to play with her hair, or say something of  a sexual nature, or sought to sleep with her. Her case is that she was  subjected to sexual harassment of a continuing and extreme form over the  fifty days the placement actually lasted: [21]
- Clinical psychologist provided report giving evidence GLS experienced  depression, low moods, worthlessness/guilt, social withdrawal, lack of  motivation, sleep disturbance, appetite and PTSD: [261]-[262]. These were dramatic changes to her previously social lifestyle: [263].
- Competing psychologist but “large measure of agreement” particularly on  PTSD and extreme depression being present: [269]
- Damages sought in vicinity of $150-200,000: [271]
- VCAT found some complaints did not cause GLS’ loss, damage or injury  and so these were discounted: [276]
- VCAT awarded $100,00 in general damages for her extreme levels of  depression, anxiety and stress: [278]-[279]
