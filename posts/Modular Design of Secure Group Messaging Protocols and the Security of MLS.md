Introduced formal security notion of [[History graph]] 

> To recover MLS security we also show that TreeKEM (as implicit to the current version in Draft 11 of MLS) [ 8 ] is indeed a passively secure CGKA according to our definition.

> Beyond MLS and TreeKEM we also prove that RTreeKEM [ 3] is a passively secure CGKA.

> TreeKEM is also related to schemes for (symmetric-key) [[Broadcast encryption]] [ 16 , 18 ] and [[Multicast encryption]] [ 12 , 24 , 30 ]
