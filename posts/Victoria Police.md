[[Intelligence-Led Policing in Practice - Reflections From Intelligence Analysts]] (2019):
>Victoria Police (2016) services a population of just under 6 million people across 237,639 km2 , has a staff of approximately 17,000, and an annual budget of $2.51 billion (AUD). \[...] It should also be noted that law enforcement in Australia is state-based, meaning Victoria Police and NSWPF service not only large municipalities but also small regional towns.

## Intelligence Capacities
Interviews from Victoria and NSW Police:

> interviewees identified a number of ==issues with their data==, including ==incompleteness== (e.g., missing data) and ==incorrectness== (e.g., information entered incorrectly into their internal criminal databases).
> *"\[...] limitations are what we’re able to see, what we are able to get, the information we don’t know, and that’s why it’s just an ongoing process . . . \[W]hen you’re dealing with people that don’t want to get caught, it’s not as easy as picking up the breadcrumbs, often you can’t find stuff out, so that’s where its limited"* (p.145)

>*"That’s \[information sharing] something we are bringing up constantly. ==We don’t have established . . . networks within the organisation and also externally==. ==There’s definitely silos \[of information]== which we are trying to break, . . . just having more open communication across all the different squads because there’s always overlaps, people try to hold onto their work. I think we need to work together a bit more"* (p.146)

> the problem of ==data overload had been compounded by the rise in the volume and veracity of the information now collected by police== (Joh, 2014; Sanders & Sheptycki, 2017), ==which now includes e-mails, text messages, computer hard drives, and instant messaging== (De´cary-He´tu & Dupont, 2012, p. 162). New sources of information is perhaps best illustrated by the rise of ==social media== (e.g., Facebook), where a recent study found that 81% of “law enforcement professionals” in the United States use social media as one source of information during investigations and one quarter use it daily (LexisNexis, 2014). This is supported by this study, with one interviewee suggesting that “one of the first checks we do is Facebook.” Interviewees also express concerns about the reliability of social media as an intelligence source. This is explained in detail by one analyst:
> *"One of the big new things is social media and ==you can look through peoples’ interactions on social media, depending on their privacy settings==, but the problem with that is you might call it the Facebook friend. You might be able to see that someone has 200 friends on Facebook and you might be able to see that their Facebook friends with so and so, and you go, wow. \[...] \[I]t’s easy to overstate connections between people because we just don’t have the visibility into the quality of that connection"* (pp.146-7)

>*"We’ve got ==horrendous IT systems== in [name of law enforcement organisation]." 
>"Technology changes daily and we’re still ==struggling to get information systems to work==. They didn’t work when we got them, and we’re still struggling, and the pressure is put on the members." 
>"Suitable software that works, that doesn’t crash would be nice"* (p.147)

>some detectives do not regard intelligence to be a valuable resource at all because it is not always prosecution oriented and may not meet evidentiary standards. There appears to be a consistent finding in which ==the primary clients of intelligence reports do not appear to properly appreciate intelligence== \[...] this lack of knowledge of intelligence is perhaps ==less of an issue with what are referred to here as “more experienced detectives,”== particularly those who have been involved in large-scale and long-term investigations that tend to have greater levels of intelligence analysis support
