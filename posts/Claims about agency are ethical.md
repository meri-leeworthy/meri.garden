Modern political theory is a set of claims about the structure of agency in the (singular) 'real world' - expressing 'geontopower' even as it critiques it. Claims about agency or reality generally are ethical in nature, express ethical ontological commitments. 

>"beginning with an ontological claim and then moving to the social, political, and historical implications of that claim recapitulates a form of colonial reason even as it seeks to confront and unravel it." [[Between Gaia and Ground]] p.23

[[Modernity]] is totalising, not a totality. Slippages are everywhere. The capture is where we allow our lives to be instrumentalised, the spiritual surrender of love and life to the lifeless artefacts of domination ([[Commodity fetishism]], laws, technologies, etc). You can't be given agency, only the conditions in which you might find it for yourself.
