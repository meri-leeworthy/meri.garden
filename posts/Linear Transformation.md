# Matrix Multiplication as Composition of Linear Transformations
Matrix multiplication can be thought of as the composition of linear transformations. In other words, if you have two matrices $A$ and $B$ representing linear transformations, the product $AB$ represents the composition of these transformations.

Here's a bit more detail:

- If $A$ represents a linear transformation $T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$, and $B$ represents a linear transformation $S: \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^n$, then the product $AB$ represents the linear transformation $T \circ S: \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^m$.

- This means that applying the transformation represented by $B$, followed by the transformation represented by $A$, is the same as applying the transformation represented by $AB$.

So in the context of linear algebra, matrix multiplication indeed corresponds to the composition of linear transformations.
