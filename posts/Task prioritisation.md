### 1. Task prioritisation

Requirement prioritisation is the process of systematically evaluating and ranking the importance and urgency of various requirements in a project or product development effort. Requirements refer to the features, functionalities, constraints, and objectives that need to be addressed to meet the goals of the project or product. Prioritisation helps project teams, stakeholders, and decision-makers determine which requirements to focus on first, which can be deferred, and which may not be necessary at all.

#### Maximising value

It ensures that the most critical and valuable requirements are addressed first, so that the project or product delivers the highest value to its stakeholders.
#### Managing risk
By addressing high-priority requirements early in the project, potential risks and uncertainties are mitigated sooner, reducing the chances of project failure or costly changes later on.

#### Resource allocation
Prioritisation helps allocate limited resources (time, budget, and personnel) effectively by directing them towards the most important and urgent requirements.

#### Stakeholder satisfaction

It ensures that the needs and expectations of key stakeholders are met, leading to higher customer and user satisfaction.


### 2. Prioritising methods

There are various methods and techniques for prioritising requirements, and the choice of method may depend on the specific context of the project. Some common prioritisation methods include:

- MoSCoW prioritisation: Requirements are categorised into Must-haves, Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves to indicate their priority.
- Numeric scoring: Assigning numerical scores to requirements based on their importance and urgency and then sorting them based on their scores.
- Kano model: Categorising requirements into basic needs, performance needs, and delighters to understand their impact on customer satisfaction.
- Risk-based prioritisation: Prioritising requirements based on their potential impact on project risks or critical business functions.
- Value-based Prioritisation: Assessing requirements in terms of their potential business value and ROI (Return on investment).
- Story mapping: Visualising requirements on a timeline to understand the flow and sequence of features, helping in prioritisation.
- Weighted decision matrices: Using a matrix to evaluate requirements based on multiple criteria such as cost, value, and feasibility.

As noted earlier, MoSCoW prioritisation is a technique used in project management and software development to prioritise requirements or features based on their importance to the project's success. The following table gives more detail on the four components of the method.

| Must have                                                                                                                                                                                            | Should have                                                                                                                           |

Effective requirement prioritisation is an ongoing process throughout a project's lifecycle. It should involve collaboration among project stakeholders, including customers, users, product owners, and development teams, to ensure that the most critical requirements are addressed in a way that maximises the project's success and the satisfaction of all relevant parties.
