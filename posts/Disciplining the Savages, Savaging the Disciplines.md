Nakata, a Torres Strait Islander scholar, has made significant contributions to Indigenous [[epistemology]] with his concept of the “cultural interface.” In his book _"Disciplining the Savages: Savaging the Disciplines"_ (2007), Nakata describes how Indigenous knowledge interacts with Western knowledge systems at the cultural interface. He critiques the colonial production of knowledge, offering instead an approach that recognises Indigenous epistemologies as complex and dynamic.
