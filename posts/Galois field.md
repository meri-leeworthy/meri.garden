In mathematics, a finite field or Galois field (so-named in honor of Ã‰variste Galois) is a field that contains a finite number of elements. As with any field, a finite field is a set on which the operations of multiplication, addition, subtraction and division are defined and satisfy certain basic rules. The most common examples of finite fields are the integers mod p when p is a prime number.

The order of a finite field is its number of elements, which is either a prime number or a prime power. For every prime number p and every positive integer k there are fields of order pk, all of which are isomorphic.
