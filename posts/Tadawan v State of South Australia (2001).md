- Application dismissed: [60]
- The applicant Ms Yohanna Tadawan is a Filipino born teacher of English as a second language. She brings a claim against the State of South Australia  as the entity responsible for the activities of the Department of Education  Training and Employment and in particular the English Language and  Literacy Service of that Department, which she alleges breached s 27 of the  RDA: [1]-[2]
- The breach complained of by Ms Tadawan is that as a result of her making  a complaint to the South Australian Equal Opportunity Commission on 15  April 1998 of alleged racial discrimination in employment she was not  offered any further employment as an hourly paid instructor (HPI) with the English Language and Literary Service (ELLS) after term 2 of 1998. In her cross-examination the applicant accepted that the decision not to provide her with employment in term 2 of 1998 was made in March 1998 before her complaint had been lodged with the Equal Opportunity Commission. She therefore accepted that there could been no victimisation in respect of that term. The applicant also agreed that if the respondent could establish that it was not aware of her complaint until after 9 July 1998 there could have been no victimisation in regard to any deployment decisions for term 3 made before that date: [3]
- The applicant claims that as a result of the victimisation which she suffered she was not offered employment by ELLS for the remainder of 1998 and 1999 although she kept in regular contact with them and requested employment. In March 2000 she obtained employment as a full time teacher at the Normanton Campus of the Mt Isa Institute of TAFE. She  claims damages for loss of earnings during the period of the alleged  victimisation until March 2000 as well as compensation and an apology from the respondent: [4]
- The complaint made by Ms Tadawan to the EOC of South Australia was based on the fact that she had been told to comply strictly with a 500 word limit on her application which she did. However, she said that other people who made applications did not restrict themselves in this way, disadvantaging her. She alleged that the other reasons given for passing her over were her lack of computing skills and experience with low level language students. She believes that she had a perfectly adequate command of computing skills and had performed well with students of low level language skills: [11]

- It was found that the complainant was not receptive to criticism and hastily prepared work attracting criticism: [45]-[46]
- The employer had no general knowledge of the complaint made to the EOC until a later time such that no decisions made prior could have been influenced in any way by the complaint: [47]
- There was also evidence the complainant’s skills were “not entirely in sync” with the employer’s requirements: [48]
- When the proceedings and the complaint which commenced them are looked at in this light, it can be seen how difficult it is in the absence of any direct evidence, to establish from inferences alone that the applicant was

the subject of victimization: [59]
