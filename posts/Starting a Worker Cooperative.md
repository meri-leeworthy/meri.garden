### Books

[[The Empowerment Manual]]. A guide for collaborative groups. [[Starhawk]]. We used the Values exercise from page 33. 
	Also, The Five Fold Path to Productive Meetings, a chapter from the above book that is available for free from [https://starhawk.org/pdfs/Empowerment_Five-Fold-Path.pdf](https://starhawk.org/pdfs/Empowerment_Five-Fold-Path.pdf)

[[Getting our Act Together]], How to harness the power of groups. [[Glen Ochre]]. [www.groupwork.com.au](http://www.groupwork.com.au)   There are some EXCELLENT trainings available from this organization. Well worth the investment. At the very least, get the book! 

[[We The People]]; Consenting to a deeper democracy. A guide to sociocratic principles and methods. How to apply the principles and dynamic self governance to our workplaces, Governments and organizations. By John Buck and Sharon Villines. [https://www.sociocracy.info/](https://www.sociocracy.info/) there is a second edition of the this book now available, which looks great and further information can be found from this website out into the world of sociocratic perspectives. By NO MEANS the only way to get there, but one way to build democratic processes.** [[Sociocracy]]
