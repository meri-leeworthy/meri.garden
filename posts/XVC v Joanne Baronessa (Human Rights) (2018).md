REASONS

THE CLAIM

[1]  Because these reasons for decision contain sensitive information about the Applicant’s health, an order was made under the Open Courts Act 2013 that she not be identified in connection with these published reasons, in which she is referred to as XVC.

[2]  XVC (the Applicant) was working for Marriott Support Services (Marriott) at a site where a railway level crossing was being replaced. A contractor called Lendlease had engaged several contractors to provide labour at the site, to manage traffic and pedestrians. Marriott was one of these and another was a company called Rail Safe Working Solutions (Rail Safe).

[3]  The Applicant’s work brought her into contact with a man I refer to as YLH, one of Rail Safe’s staff. The Applicant says that YLH made comments of a sexual nature and comments about violence either to her or in her presence on several occasions. The Applicant says that she was afraid of him, that she told the Lendlease supervisor about his comments, that others at the work‐site asked her to document her complaints, and that she reported all this to Marriott. Joanne Baronessa, the First Respondent, was the Marriott staff member who dealt with her about all this.

[4]  The Applicant claims that the Respondents, in regard to these matters, discriminated against her on the ground of her sex, in breach of section 18 of the Equal Opportunity Act 2010(the Act), that the Respondents authorised or assisted the sexual harassment by YLH, in breach of section 105 of the Act, that Marriott is vicariously liable for the First Respondent’s conduct under section 109 of the Act and that the Respondents victimised her in breach of section 103 of the Act.


## Order

The Respondents must pay to the Applicant the sum of $10,000 for non-economic loss.
